# Planning

This folder contains tasks and projects that are being actively planned and designed. Items here are being analyzed, scoped, and prepared for implementation.

## Purpose

- Define project requirements and specifications
- Create implementation plans and timelines
- Conduct feasibility analysis
- Assign resources and responsibilities
- Break down large tasks into actionable items

Items move here from the backlog once they've been prioritized, and advance to in-progress once planning is complete and implementation can begin.
