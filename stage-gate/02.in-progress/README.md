# In Progress

This folder contains tasks and projects that are currently being actively worked on. Items here have completed planning and are in the implementation phase.

## Purpose

- Track active development work
- Monitor progress on ongoing tasks
- Manage work-in-progress limits
- Coordinate team efforts
- Document implementation decisions and blockers

Items move here from planning once work begins, and advance to completed once all acceptance criteria are met and the work is finished.
