# Completed

This folder contains tasks and projects that have been finished and delivered. Items here represent work that has met all acceptance criteria and been closed.

## Purpose

- Archive completed work for reference
- Track delivery history and metrics
- Store lessons learned and retrospectives
- Maintain records for reporting and analysis
- Provide examples for future similar work

Items move here from in-progress once all work is complete, tested, and accepted. This serves as a historical record of accomplished tasks.
