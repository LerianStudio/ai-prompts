# Workflows

This directory contains YAML workflow definitions that orchestrate the Lerian Protocol automation processes.

## Purpose

The workflows folder serves as a centralized location for:

- YAML workflow orchestration files
- Process definitions and step sequences
- Agent coordination specifications
- Input/output parameter definitions
- Validation and error handling rules
- Workflow execution configurations

## Structure

This directory is organized to provide workflow definitions that control how agents, templates, and context knowledge are combined to produce automated outputs through the stage-gate system.

## Getting Started

To create new workflows, define YAML files in this folder that specify the workflow steps, required inputs, agent assignments, template usage, and output specifications as outlined in the workflow schema documentation.
