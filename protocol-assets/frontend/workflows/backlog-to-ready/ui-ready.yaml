    I've completed comprehensive frontend analysis using the analyze-frontend command. The analysis reveals:

    **Frontend Architecture Patterns:**
    {frontend_architecture_summary}

    **Component System:**
    {component_system_summary}

    **Styling Patterns:**
    {styling_patterns_summary}

    **Design System Usage:**
    {design_system_summary}

    **Accessibility Standards:**
    {accessibility_standards}

    Generated: `frontend-patterns.md` with complete frontend pattern analysis including:
    - shadcn/ui component patterns with Radix primitives
    - Tailwind CSS utility patterns and custom component classes
    - Responsive design breakpoints and mobile-first approaches
    - Animation and interaction patterns
    - Accessibility implementations (ARIA, semantic HTML)
    - Design token usage and theme system integration

    Please proceed with UI-focused user story generation, ensuring stories emphasize visual outcomes,
    interaction requirements, and frontend user experience goals.

  user-story-generator-to-ui-ux-specialist: >-
    I've analyzed the UI-focused backlog tasks and generated frontend-specific user stories:
    {ui_user_stories_summary}

    **Frontend Pattern Context:**
    - Component System: shadcn/ui components following project patterns
    - Styling: Tailwind CSS with existing design tokens
    - Desktop Focus: 1920×1080 primary target (mobile later)
    - Basic Interactions: Click, hover, focus states

    Please create simple UI specifications focused on practical desktop implementation:
    1. Basic component requirements (which shadcn/ui components to use)
    2. Simple visual layout (ASCII diagram or basic description)
    3. Desktop styling guidance following project patterns
    4. Essential interactions (click handlers, basic hover states)
    5. Functional requirements rather than pixel-perfect specs
    Keep it simple and implementation-focused. Skip complex responsive and accessibility specs for now.

  ui-ux-specialist-to-task-breakdown-specialist: >-
    I have completed the simple UI design phase for the user stories.
    The UI specification file (`ui-spec.md`) contains practical implementation guidance focused on desktop functionality.

    Generated UI Specs:
    {ui_spec_files_summary}

    **UI Design Highlights:**
    - Basic component requirements with shadcn/ui integration
    - Simple visual layout and structure
    - Desktop styling guidance following project patterns
    - Essential interaction definitions
    - Functional requirements focused on implementation

    **CRITICAL: Use mcp__lerian-board__createTask instead of file operations**

    Your task is to create a comprehensive database-backed implementation task:

    1. **Use mcp__lerian-board__createTask** with:
       - Title: "UI Implementation: {Story Name}"
       - Description: Complete UI specification and implementation requirements
       - Todos: Structured by implementation phases (18-24 todos total)

    2. **Organize todos in logical phases:**
       - Component Development (3-4 todos)
       - Styling Implementation (3-4 todos)
       - Interactive Features (3-4 todos)  
       - Responsive Design (3-4 todos)
       - Accessibility Compliance (3-4 todos)
       - Testing & Integration (3-4 todos)

    3. **Return task_id** for downstream agents and workflows

    4. **No file system operations** - everything goes in the database

    UI-Only Backlog processing workflow completed successfully using Board MCP server!

    Summary of processed frontend work:
    - Analyzed frontend patterns and component architecture
    - Generated UI-focused user stories with visual acceptance criteria
    - Created comprehensive UI specifications for implementation guidance
    - **Created database-backed task via mcp__lerian-board__createTask**
    - **Generated structured todos organized by implementation phases**
    - **Returned task_id: {task_id} for downstream coordination**

    **Key Benefits of New System:**
    - ✅ Reliable database storage vs fragile file operations
    - ✅ Atomic task operations with transaction safety
    - ✅ Centralized progress tracking across all agents
    - ✅ Auto task completion when all todos finished
    - ✅ Task_id-based coordination instead of file paths

    **Next Steps:**
    - Implementation agents receive task_id: {task_id}
    - Use mcp__lerian-board__getTask(task_id) to access todos
    - Progress tracked via mcp__lerian-board__completeTodoItem()
    - Task status updates via mcp__lerian-board__updateTaskStatus()

    The task is now ready for streamlined frontend implementation with full database backing!
