- Bundle optimization and code splitting strategies
- Rendering optimization and memoization techniques
- Asset optimization and loading strategies

### Accessibility & User Experience

- WCAG compliance implementation guides
- Screen reader compatibility and ARIA patterns
- Keyboard navigation and focus management
- Responsive design and mobile optimization

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- Component testing strategies using React Testing Library
- Visual regression testing with Playwright and Storybook
- End-to-end testing patterns and best practices
- Test-driven development approaches for frontend components

## Documentation Organization

Documentation is organized by:

- **Development Phase**: Planning, implementation, testing, deployment
- **Component Type**: UI primitives, business components, layout components
- **Complexity Level**: Basic patterns to advanced architectural concerns
- **Integration Points**: API integration, state management, routing

## Implementation Guides

- **Component Development**: Step-by-step component creation guides
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and Context API patterns
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form integration with validation
- **Data Fetching**: React Query patterns and API integration strategies

## Contributing

When adding frontend documentation:

1. **Practical Examples**: Include working code examples and demos
2. **Visual References**: Include screenshots and interactive examples
3. **Cross-Platform**: Consider mobile, tablet, and desktop implementations
4. **Accessibility Focus**: Ensure all patterns include accessibility considerations

## Integration Points

Frontend documentation integrates with:

- **Backend Documentation**: API contracts and integration patterns
- **Design System**: Component specifications and implementation guides
- **Quality Standards**: Testing protocols and performance requirements
