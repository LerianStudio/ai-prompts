## Components

### Design System (`design-system/`)

Frontend design system and UI component specifications:

- Component library documentation and specifications
- Design tokens, colors, typography, and spacing
- Interaction patterns and micro-animations
- Responsive design patterns and breakpoints

**Purpose:**

- Ensure consistent user interface implementation
- Standardize component behavior and appearance
- Support design-to-development handoff process
- Maintain visual brand consistency across features

### Documentation (`docs/`)

Frontend-specific technical documentation:

- Component implementation patterns and best practices
- State management and data flow documentation
- Performance optimization strategies and techniques
- Accessibility implementation guides and standards

**Purpose:**

- Support frontend development best practices
- Document React patterns and component architecture
- Maintain performance and accessibility standards
- Enable efficient development workflows

### UI References (`ui-references/`)

Visual references and component examples:

- Component screenshots and visual documentation
- Figma design exports and specifications
- Reference implementations and example usage
- Visual regression testing baselines

**Purpose:**

- Provide visual context for component implementation
- Support visual validation and testing processes
- Maintain design-development alignment
- Enable pixel-perfect implementation

### Workflows (`workflows/`)

Frontend development workflows and automation:

- Component development and testing workflows
- Visual validation and screenshot testing
- Build optimization and deployment processes
- Storybook integration and documentation

**Purpose:**

- Automate frontend development lifecycle
- Ensure visual quality and consistency
- Support component-driven development
- Maintain design system integrity

## Team Integration

The frontend assets integrate with:

- **Shared**: Common standards and board management
- **Backend**: API integration patterns and data contracts
- **Content**: Technical documentation and component guides
- **Quality**: UI testing protocols and validation standards

## Contributing

When adding frontend assets:

1. **Design System**: Focus on reusable components and design tokens
2. **Documentation**: Include component usage patterns and best practices
3. **UI References**: Provide clear visual examples and specifications
4. **Workflows**: Support visual validation and component testing

## Maintenance

- Regular component library updates and documentation
- Continuous visual regression testing and validation
- Design system evolution tracking and migration guides
- Integration with shared quality standards and testing protocols
