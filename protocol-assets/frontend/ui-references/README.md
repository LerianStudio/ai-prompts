## Components

### Component References (`component-refs/`)
Component implementation references and visual examples:
- Interactive component demos and usage examples
- State variation examples showing all component states
- Responsive behavior documentation with breakpoint examples
- Accessibility implementation examples with screen reader support

**Purpose:**
- Provide visual validation for component implementations
- Support design-development alignment and approval processes
- Enable visual regression testing and quality assurance
- Document component behavior across different contexts

### Figma Exports (`figma-exports/`)
Design specifications and exported assets:
- High-fidelity design mockups and component specifications
- Design token exports and style guide references
- Asset exports including icons, illustrations, and graphics
- Design system updates and component specification changes

**Purpose:**
- Bridge design and development with accurate specifications
- Provide authoritative design references for implementation
- Support design system consistency and brand alignment
- Enable pixel-perfect implementation validation

### Screenshots (`screenshots/`)
Application screenshots and visual documentation:
- Feature implementation screenshots and workflow captures
- Cross-browser compatibility testing screenshots
- Mobile and responsive design validation captures
- Visual regression testing baseline images

**Purpose:**
- Document implemented features and user interface states
- Support visual testing and regression validation
- Enable cross-platform compatibility verification
- Provide visual context for feature development and reviews

## Visual Validation Workflow

1. **Design Handoff**: Figma exports provide implementation specifications
2. **Implementation**: Component refs guide development and testing
3. **Validation**: Screenshots capture implementation for review and approval
4. **Regression Testing**: Visual baselines ensure ongoing quality and consistency

## Quality Standards

### Image Organization
- **Consistent Naming**: Descriptive filenames following established conventions
- **Version Control**: Track design changes and implementation iterations
- **Optimization**: Appropriately sized images for their intended use
- **Accessibility**: Alt text and descriptions for visual references

### Visual Validation
- **Pixel Perfect**: Exact match to design specifications when required
- **Responsive Design**: Validation across all target devices and breakpoints
- **Cross-Browser**: Consistency verification across supported browsers
- **Accessibility**: Visual validation of accessibility features and patterns

## Contributing

When adding UI references:
1. **Clear Context**: Include descriptive information about the visual reference
2. **Version Tracking**: Document design version and implementation status
3. **Accessibility**: Include accessibility-focused visual documentation
4. **Cross-Platform**: Capture references across different devices and browsers

## Integration Points

UI references integrate with:
- **Design System**: Visual validation of component specifications
- **Quality Testing**: Visual regression testing and validation protocols
- **Documentation**: Visual examples supporting technical documentation
