- React component implementation guidelines and patterns
- Component composition and compound component strategies
- State management patterns for interactive components

### Design Tokens & Standards

- Color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems
- Responsive breakpoints and grid system specifications
- Animation timing functions and transition patterns
- Accessibility standards and ARIA implementation guidelines

### Implementation Patterns

- CSS-in-JS implementation strategies and best practices
- Styled components patterns and theme integration
- Custom hook patterns for component behavior
- Testing strategies for design system components

### Documentation & Examples

- Storybook integration and component documentation
- Interactive examples and usage patterns

## Organization

Design system assets are organized by:

- **Component Category**: Basic, composite, and layout components
- **Complexity Level**: Atomic components to complex patterns
- **Usage Context**: General purpose vs. domain-specific components
- **Implementation Status**: Stable, experimental, deprecated

## Design Tokens Structure

- **Core Tokens**: Primitive values (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Semantic Tokens**: Contextual meanings (primary, secondary, error)
- **Component Tokens**: Component-specific values and variants
- **Theme Tokens**: Light/dark mode and brand variations

## Contributing

When adding design system assets:

1. **Component Documentation**: Include comprehensive usage guidelines
2. **Accessibility First**: Ensure all components meet WCAG standards
3. **Testing Coverage**: Include visual regression and interaction tests
4. **Cross-Platform**: Consider responsive and mobile-first implementations

## Integration Points

Frontend design system integrates with:

- **Backend APIs**: Consistent data presentation patterns
- **Quality Standards**: Accessibility and performance requirements
- **Shared Standards**: Cross-team design consistency guidelines
