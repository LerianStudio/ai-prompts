# 01. Backlog

## Purpose

The Backlog stage represents ideas, features, and enhancements that have been identified but not yet prioritized for implementation. Items in the backlog are waiting to be refined, estimated, and scheduled for development.

## Entry Criteria

Items enter the Backlog when:

- New ideas or feature requests are submitted
- Bugs or issues are reported but not urgent
- Technical debt items are identified
- Enhancement opportunities are discovered
- User feedback suggests improvements

## What Belongs Here

- **Unrefined Ideas**: Concepts that need further exploration
- **Feature Requests**: User-requested functionality not yet planned
- **Low Priority Bugs**: Issues that don't block current functionality
- **Technical Improvements**: Code refactoring or optimization opportunities
- **Documentation Needs**: Identified gaps in documentation
- **Future Enhancements**: Nice-to-have features for future releases

## Exit Criteria

Items move from Backlog to Ready when:

- Requirements are clearly defined
- Acceptance criteria are established
- Dependencies are identified
- Effort has been estimated
- Priority has been assigned
- Team capacity is available

## File Naming Convention

```
task-[number]-[brief-description].md
```

## Review Process

Backlog items should be reviewed regularly to:

- Remove outdated or irrelevant items
- Combine duplicate requests
- Update priorities based on business value
- Identify items ready for refinement
- Archive completed or cancelled items

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Organized**: Group related items together
2. **Regular Grooming**: Review and clean up weekly
3. **Clear Descriptions**: Ensure items are understandable
4. **Avoid Bloat**: Don't let the backlog grow indefinitely
5. **Prioritize Regularly**: Reassess priorities as needs change
