# Ready for Implementation Phase

This phase contains features with complete UI designs that have been broken down into implementation tasks and are ready for development work.

## Purpose
Bridge complete UI designs with technical implementation, providing developers with specifications and task breakdowns.

## Work Items Include
- Technical implementation breakdown
- Sub-task definitions with UI design references
- Implementation todos and development tasks
- Technical architecture specifications
- Complete UI specifications from design phase

## Entry Criteria
- Complete UI design from `02.ui-design/`
- UI specification document completed
- Design quality review passed
- Technical feasibility confirmed

## Exit Criteria
- Technical breakdown completed
- Sub-tasks defined with clear scope
- Implementation todos generated
- Development dependencies identified
- Ready for active development

## Technical Planning
- Reference UI specifications from design phase
- Create implementation-focused task breakdown
- Generate technical architecture based on designs
- Include UI component implementation todos
- Define testing and validation requirements

## Agent Ownership
Primary: `task-breakdown-specialist`
Secondary: `todo-manager` for task generation
Review: Technical leads and developers

## Next Phase
Items move to `03.in-progress/` when developers begin active implementation work.
