# Board System

This directory implements a kanban board system for managing work items through their lifecycle.

## Structure

```
board/
├── 01.backlog/     # New ideas and requests
├── 02.ready/       # Refined and ready to start
├── 03.in-progress/ # Work in progress (WIP limit: 5)
├── 04.testing/     # Code review & testing
└── 05.completed/   # Completed work
```

## Workflow Rules

1. **WIP Limits**: Maximum 5 items in active, 2 per person
2. **Flow Direction**: inbox → ready → active → review → done
3. **Blocked Items**: Keep in active with `[BLOCKED]` prefix
4. **Review Time**: Items in review > 3 days need escalation

## Naming Conventions

- Simple: `feature-name/`
- With status: `[WIP-owner]_feature-name/`
- Blocked: `[BLOCKED]_feature-name/`
- Priority: `[P1]_critical-feature/`

## Todo Manager Agent Integration

Board items now support intelligent task management through the **todo-manager agent**, providing proactive, context-aware workflow orchestration:

### Agent-Based Task Management

```bash
# Direct agent invocation for board item analysis
@todo-manager "Analyze task-392 and create comprehensive implementation todos"

# Intelligent workload optimization across board items
@todo-manager "Review all active board items and suggest task prioritization"

# Cross-board dependency coordination
@todo-manager "Analyze dependencies between user-auth and payment-system board items"
```

### Workflow Integration

The todo-manager agent seamlessly integrates with workflows for automated task management:

```yaml
# Example: Feature implementation workflow
- agent: todo-manager
  task: 'Create implementation todos for board item {{board-item-id}}'
- agent: code-reviewer
  task: 'Generate quality checklist based on implementation plan'
- agent: todo-manager
  task: 'Integrate quality requirements and finalize todo plan'
```

### Agent Capabilities

- **Contextual Analysis**: Understands board item scope, complexity, and requirements
- **Implementation Planning**: Breaks down board items into actionable todos
- **Cross-Board Intelligence**: Manages dependencies and coordinates across board items
- **Quality Integration**: Collaborates with code-reviewer and tech-writer agents
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Enables complex multi-agent task management

### Board Item vs Todo Distinction

- **Board Items**: Strategic features, epics, major deliverables moving through kanban stages
- **Todos**: Tactical implementation tasks generated and managed by todo-manager agent

### File Structure

Board items contain `todos.md` files managed by the todo-manager agent:

```
board/03.in-progress/user-auth-feature/
├── README.md          # Main board item description with basic metadata
└── todos.md          # Implementation todos (managed by todo-manager agent)
```

## Board Item Structure

Each board item is a folder containing:

### README.md

- **Primary documentation** for the board item
- **Basic metadata** in the content (title, description, acceptance criteria)
- **Human-readable** format that integrates naturally with markdown workflows
- **Single source of truth** for board item information

### todos.md (Generated by todo-manager agent)

- **Implementation tasks** broken down from the board item
- **Tactical execution steps** managed by Claude Code's todo-manager agent
- **Automatically generated** based on board item requirements
- **Integrated** with Claude Code's native TodoWrite system

### Benefits of Simplified Structure

- **No duplication**: Single README.md file contains all board item information
- **Native integration**: Leverages Claude Code's existing TodoWrite and todo-manager systems
- **Human-centric**: Developers work primarily with markdown files they're familiar with
- **Minimal overhead**: No separate metadata files to maintain or keep in sync
- **Git-friendly**: Markdown files provide clear diffs and history tracking
