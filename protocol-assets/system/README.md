# System Layer

The system layer contains core operational components that drive project execution and management.

## Structure

```
system/
├── board/           # Project management and task organization
└── workflows/       # Automated processes and development workflows
```

## Components

### Board (`board/`)
Project management infrastructure including:
- Task boards and sprint planning
- Issue tracking and prioritization
- Project status and progress monitoring
- Team collaboration spaces

**Key Features:**
- Organized task management
- Clear status tracking
- Team visibility and coordination
- Progress reporting and metrics

### Workflows (`workflows/`)
Automated processes and development workflows including:
- CI/CD pipeline definitions
- Code review processes
- Testing and deployment automation
- Development lifecycle management

**Key Features:**
- Standardized development processes
- Automated quality checks
- Consistent deployment procedures
- Integration with development tools

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Board Content
1. Follow established board structure patterns
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions
3. Include proper task categorization
4. Ensure clear status indicators

### Creating New Workflows
1. Use standard workflow templates
2. Include proper error handling
3. Document workflow dependencies
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

## Integration Points

The system layer integrates with:
- **Content Layer**: Documentation and templates support system processes
- **Quality Layer**: Standards and testing protocols are enforced through workflows
- **Media Layer**: Screenshots and visuals support project documentation

## Maintenance

- Regular cleanup of completed tasks
- Periodic workflow optimization
- Updates to reflect process changes
- Documentation synchronization
