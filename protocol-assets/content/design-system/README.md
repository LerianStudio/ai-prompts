# Design System [PLACEHOLDER - NOT YET DEFINED]

> ⚠️ **Project Status**: This design system is in the planning phase.
> None of the specifications below are implemented or finalized.

## Current Status: Planning Phase

This directory will contain our design system specifications once they are defined.
Currently, no design decisions have been finalized.

## Planned Components (Future)

### 🎨 Color Palette [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define primary, secondary, and semantic colors
- Will include accessibility guidelines and contrast ratios
- Will specify exact RGB/HSL values for consistency
- **File**: `color-palette.md` (to be created)

### 📝 Typography [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define font families, sizes, and hierarchy
- Will include component-specific typography rules
- Will establish line-height and spacing standards
- **File**: `typography.md` (to be created)

### 🧩 Component Standards [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define button, form, and layout standards
- Will include interaction states and accessibility requirements
- Will specify sizing, spacing, and responsive behavior
- **File**: `component-standards.md` (to be created)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Conduct design system audit of existing components
- [ ] Define color palette based on brand requirements
- [ ] Establish typography hierarchy and font stack
- [ ] Document component specifications with exact measurements
- [ ] Create accessibility and interaction guidelines
- [ ] Implement validation rules for design consistency

## Contributing

When ready to populate this design system:

1. **Create individual specification files** for each component area
2. **Use this README as a checklist** for tracking completion
3. **Update project status** when specifications are finalized
4. **Follow established patterns** from existing UI validation tools

## File Structure (Future)

```
design-system/
├── README.md (this file)
├── color-palette.md (color specifications and accessibility)
├── typography.md (font hierarchy and text styling)
└── component-standards.md (UI component specifications)
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not implement any UI components based on placeholder content.
Wait for official design system specifications to be created and approved.
