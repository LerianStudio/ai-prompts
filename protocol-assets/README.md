# Protocol Assets - Layered Architecture

A structured collection of development protocols, standards, and assets organized in a clean 4-layer architecture for maximum clarity and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

The protocol-assets folder uses a layered architecture that separates concerns and creates clear boundaries between different types of development assets:

```
protocol-assets/
├── system/          # Core workflow and project management
├── content/         # Knowledge base and documentation
├── quality/         # Standards and testing protocols
└── media/           # Visual assets and screenshots
```

## Layer Descriptions

### 🏗️ System Layer (`system/`)
Core operational components that drive project execution:
- **board/** - Project management boards and task organization
- **workflows/** - Automated processes and development workflows

### 📚 Content Layer (`content/`)
Knowledge base and documentation assets:
- **context/** - Domain knowledge and reference materials
- **design-system/** - UI/UX guidelines and design patterns
- **documentation/** - Technical documentation and guides
- **templates/** - Reusable templates and boilerplates

### ⚡ Quality Layer (`quality/`)
Standards and validation protocols:
- **standards/** - Code quality and development standards
- **testing/** - Test scenarios and validation protocols
- **compatibility/** - Cross-platform and browser compatibility guidelines

### 🎨 Media Layer (`media/`)
Visual assets and media files:
- **screenshots/** - Application screenshots and visual documentation

## Navigation Guide

### For Project Management
- Task boards and sprint planning → `system/board/`
- Workflow automation → `system/workflows/`

### For Development
- Code standards and guidelines → `quality/standards/`
- Design patterns and components → `content/design-system/`
- Technical documentation → `content/documentation/`

### For Testing & QA
- Test scenarios → `quality/testing/`
- Validation protocols → `quality/testing/`
- Browser compatibility → `quality/compatibility/`

### For Design & Documentation
- Templates and boilerplates → `content/templates/`
- Screenshots and visuals → `media/screenshots/`
- Context and reference materials → `content/context/`

## Benefits of This Architecture

### ✅ Clear Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a distinct purpose, eliminating confusion about where to place or find assets.

### ✅ Scalable Organization
The layered approach grows naturally as new content is added without creating clutter.

### ✅ Improved Discoverability
Logical grouping makes it easier to find relevant assets quickly.

### ✅ Reduced Duplication
Clear boundaries prevent the same type of content from being scattered across multiple locations.

## Migration from Previous Structure

The previous 11-folder structure has been consolidated into this 4-layer architecture:

| Old Location | New Location | Layer |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| `board/` | `system/board/` | System |
| `workflows/` | `system/workflows/` | System |
| `context/` | `content/context/` | Content |
| `documentation/` | `content/documentation/` | Content |
| `templates/` | `content/templates/` | Content |
| `design-guides/` | `content/design-system/` | Content |
| `checklists/` | `quality/standards/` | Quality |
| `validation-rules/` | `quality/testing/` | Quality |
| `test-scenarios/` | `quality/testing/` | Quality |
| `browser-data/` | `quality/compatibility/` | Quality |
| `screenshots/` | `media/screenshots/` | Media |

## Getting Started

1. **Browse by Purpose**: Use the layer structure to navigate to the type of asset you need
2. **Check Layer READMEs**: Each layer contains its own README with specific guidance
3. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Maintain the established patterns when adding new content
4. **Update References**: When moving or renaming files, update all cross-references

## Contributing

When adding new assets to this structure:

1. **Identify the Layer**: Determine which layer best fits your content's purpose
2. **Check for Existing Patterns**: Look at existing organization within that layer
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established naming and organization conventions
4. **Update Cross-References**: Ensure all links and references remain valid

## Maintenance

This structure is designed for long-term maintainability:
- Regular cleanup of outdated content
- Periodic review of cross-references
- Evolution of standards as the project grows
- Documentation updates to reflect structural changes
