## Components

### Board (`board/`)

Cross-team project management infrastructure:

- Unified task management and prioritization system
- Cross-functional collaboration spaces
- Project status and milestone tracking
- Team coordination and communication hubs

**Purpose:**

- Enable cross-team collaboration and visibility
- Standardize project management across all teams
- Coordinate shared resources and dependencies
- Track organizational goals and milestones

### Documentation (`docs/`)

Shared documentation and team resources:

- Organizational standards and best practices
- Cross-team integration guides and protocols
- Shared libraries and common utilities documentation
- Team onboarding and knowledge sharing resources

**Purpose:**

- Provide universal reference materials for all teams
- Document shared standards and common practices
- Support cross-team knowledge transfer
- Maintain organizational development guidelines

### Screenshots (`screenshots/`)

Common screenshots and visual references:

- Cross-platform visual documentation
- Shared UI component references
- System-wide visual standards and examples
- Universal design pattern implementations

**Purpose:**

- Provide consistent visual references across teams
- Support cross-platform development and testing
- Maintain visual consistency standards
- Enable shared visual validation processes

### Standards (`standards/`)

Cross-cutting development standards:

- Code quality standards and linting configurations
- Security protocols and implementation guidelines
- Performance standards and optimization requirements
- Accessibility standards and compliance requirements

**Purpose:**

- Ensure consistent quality across all development areas
- Standardize security and performance practices
- Maintain accessibility compliance organization-wide
- Provide unified development guidelines

### Templates (`templates/`)

Universal templates and boilerplates:

- Project structure templates and scaffolding
- Documentation templates and formats
- Configuration file templates and defaults
- Workflow templates and automation scripts

**Purpose:**

- Accelerate development across all teams
- Ensure consistency in project structure and setup
- Standardize documentation and configuration patterns
- Support rapid prototyping and development

## Cross-Team Integration

The shared assets serve as the foundation for:

- **Backend Team**: Common standards and integration patterns
- **Frontend Team**: Shared UI standards and visual consistency
- **Quality Assurance**: Universal testing and validation protocols
- **Design Teams**: Cross-platform design system integration

## Contributing

When adding shared assets:

1. **Universality**: Ensure content applies across all teams and contexts
2. **Standards Alignment**: Maintain consistency with organizational guidelines
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear usage instructions and examples
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to team-specific implementations and extensions

## Maintenance

- Regular review of shared standards and their adoption
- Continuous improvement of cross-team collaboration tools
- Updates to reflect organizational changes and growth
- Integration with team-specific assets and workflows
