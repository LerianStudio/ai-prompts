## Standards Organization

Standards are organized by:

- **Scope**: Individual developer, team, organization, or industry level
- **Enforcement Level**: Required, recommended, or optional guidelines
- **Technology Stack**: Language, framework, or platform-specific standards
- **Lifecycle Stage**: Development, testing, deployment, or maintenance standards

### Implementation Levels

- **Required Standards**: Must be followed for all development work
- **Team Standards**: Consistent practices within specific teams
- **Recommended Practices**: Suggested approaches for common scenarios
- **Experimental Guidelines**: Emerging practices under evaluation

### Compliance and Validation

- **Automated Checking**: Linting, testing, and validation automation
- **Manual Reviews**: Code review checklists and approval processes
- **Quality Gates**: Standards verification in CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Ongoing compliance tracking and improvement metrics

## Standards Evolution

### Review and Update Process

- **Regular Assessment**: Periodic review of standard effectiveness and relevance
- **Team Feedback Integration**: Input from all teams on standard practicality
- **Industry Alignment**: Updates to reflect evolving best practices
- **Tool Integration**: Standards updates to leverage new development tools

### Communication and Training

- **Onboarding**: New team member training on organizational standards
- **Update Notifications**: Communication of standards changes and updates
- **Training Materials**: Resources for understanding and implementing standards
- **Best Practice Sharing**: Cross-team knowledge sharing and improvement

## Contributing

When adding or updating shared standards:

1. **Cross-Team Applicability**: Ensure standards apply across multiple teams
2. **Practical Implementation**: Include clear guidelines for implementation
3. **Automated Validation**: Provide tooling or automation where possible
4. **Documentation**: Include rationale and examples for standard adoption

## Integration Points

Shared standards integrate with:

- **Team-Specific Standards**: Backend, frontend, and quality-specific guidelines
- **Quality Protocols**: Testing and validation requirement alignment
- **Workflow Automation**: CI/CD pipeline integration and enforcement
