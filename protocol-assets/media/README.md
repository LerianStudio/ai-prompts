# Media Layer

The media layer contains visual assets and media files that support documentation, design, and communication across the project.

## Structure

```
media/
└── screenshots/     # Application screenshots and visual documentation
```

## Components

### Screenshots (`screenshots/`)
Application screenshots and visual documentation:
- User interface captures and mockups
- Feature demonstrations and tutorials
- Before/after comparison images
- Error state and edge case documentation

**Organization Principles:**
- Categorized by feature or functionality
- Timestamped for version tracking
- Consistent naming conventions
- Multiple resolution variants where needed

## Asset Management Guidelines

### Screenshot Standards
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080 for desktop, appropriate mobile resolutions
- **Format**: PNG for UI elements, JPEG for photographs, SVG for diagrams
- **Compression**: Optimized for web while maintaining clarity
- **Annotation**: Clear callouts and highlights where necessary

### Naming Conventions
```
[component]-[action]-[state]-[date].[extension]
```

Examples:
- `dashboard-overview-default-2024-03.png`
- `login-form-error-state-2024-03.png`
- `mobile-nav-expanded-2024-03.png`

### File Organization
```

├── ui-components/          # Individual component captures
├── user-flows/            # Complete workflow demonstrations
├── mobile/                # Mobile-specific screenshots
├── desktop/               # Desktop-specific screenshots
├── error-states/          # Error and edge case documentation
└── comparisons/           # Before/after and A/B test images
```

## Quality Standards

### Visual Quality
- Sharp, clear images without compression artifacts
- Consistent browser chrome and styling
- Proper aspect ratios and scaling
- Accessible contrast and color choices

### Documentation Value
- Screenshots that clearly illustrate the described functionality
- Annotations and callouts that highlight important elements
- Consistent visual style across all captures
- Regular updates to reflect current UI state

### Technical Requirements
- Optimized file sizes for web delivery
- Appropriate metadata and alt text descriptions
- Version control friendly formats
- Accessible color schemes and contrast ratios

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Updates
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Check screenshots against current application state
- **Feature Updates**: Capture new functionality as it's released
- **UI Changes**: Update screenshots when interface changes occur
- **Cleanup**: Remove outdated or superseded images

### Workflow Integration
- Automated screenshot capture for critical user flows
- Integration with testing frameworks for regression detection
- Version tagging aligned with application releases
- Consistent capture environments and settings

## Usage Guidelines

### For Documentation
- Reference screenshots using relative paths from the media layer
- Include alt text descriptions for accessibility
- Provide context and explanation alongside visual elements
- Maintain consistency with content layer documentation

### For Design Review
- Capture multiple states and responsive breakpoints
- Document interaction states and hover effects
- Include comparative screenshots for design iterations
- Maintain organized collections by feature or epic

### For Testing and QA
- Document expected vs. actual visual outcomes
- Capture error states and edge cases
- Provide reference images for visual regression testing
- Maintain baseline images for automated testing

## Integration Points

The media layer supports:
- **System Layer**: Visual documentation for workflows and board processes
- **Content Layer**: Screenshots and diagrams for technical documentation
- **Quality Layer**: Visual standards and accessibility compliance examples

## Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools
- **Capture**: Browser developer tools, specialized screenshot utilities
- **Editing**: GIMP, Figma, or similar tools for annotations and optimization
- **Optimization**: ImageOptim, TinyPNG for file size reduction
- **Automation**: Playwright, Puppeteer for automated screenshot generation

### Automated Workflows
- Scheduled screenshot capture for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing integration
- Automatic optimization and format conversion
- Metadata extraction and organization

## Contributing

When adding media assets:
1. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use consistent, descriptive file names
2. **Optimize File Sizes**: Balance quality with performance requirements
3. **Include Metadata**: Add descriptions, timestamps, and context information
4. **Organize Appropriately**: Place files in the correct subdirectory
5. **Update References**: Ensure all documentation links remain valid
6. **Consider Accessibility**: Include alt text and ensure sufficient contrast

## Storage and Performance

### File Size Guidelines
- Screenshots: Target < 500KB per image
- Diagrams: Prefer SVG for scalability
- Photographs: Use appropriate JPEG compression
- Animations: Consider WebP or modern formats

### Delivery Optimization
- Responsive image sizing for different viewports
- Lazy loading for large image collections
- CDN integration for improved performance
- Progressive enhancement for slower connections
