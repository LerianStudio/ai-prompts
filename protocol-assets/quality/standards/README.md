# Quality Standards [PLACEHOLDER - NOT YET DEFINED]

> ⚠️ **Project Status**: Quality standards are in the planning phase.
> None of the specifications below are implemented or finalized.

## Current Status: Planning Phase

This directory will contain our quality standards and validation rules once they are defined.
Currently, no quality criteria have been established.

## Planned Quality Standards (Future)

### 🏗️ Code Quality Standards [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quality requirements
- Will include linting rules and code formatting standards
- Will specify error handling and performance patterns
- **File**: `code-quality-standards.md` (to be created)

### ♿ Accessibility Requirements [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- Will include automated testing rules and validation criteria
- Will specify keyboard navigation and screen reader standards
- **File**: `accessibility-requirements.md` (to be created)

### 🌐 Browser Compatibility Standards [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define supported browser versions and testing matrix
- Will include polyfill requirements and fallback strategies
- Will specify cross-browser testing procedures
- **File**: `browser-compatibility.md` (to be created)

### ⚡ Performance Standards [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define Core Web Vitals thresholds and benchmarks
- Will include component-specific performance requirements
- Will specify memory usage and optimization standards
- **File**: `performance-standards.md` (to be created)

### 🎨 Design System Compliance [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define visual consistency requirements
- Will include component standardization rules
- Will specify brand guideline adherence criteria
- **File**: `design-compliance.md` (to be created)

### 📝 Documentation Standards [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define component documentation requirements
- Will include API documentation and example standards
- Will specify maintenance and migration guide requirements
- **File**: `documentation-standards.md` (to be created)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Establish baseline quality requirements for the project
- [ ] Define accessibility compliance levels (WCAG 2.1 A/AA/AAA)
- [ ] Set performance benchmarks based on target audience
- [ ] Create browser support matrix based on user analytics
- [ ] Establish code quality metrics and thresholds
- [ ] Define documentation standards and templates

## Contributing

When ready to establish quality standards:

1. **Assess current project needs** and establish baseline requirements
2. **Create individual standards files** for each quality area
3. **Define measurable criteria** with specific thresholds and benchmarks
4. **Implement validation tools** for automated quality checking
5. **Update project status** when standards are approved and implemented

## File Structure (Future)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not implement quality validation or establish testing criteria based on placeholder content.
Wait for official quality standards to be researched, defined, and approved by the project team.
