# Quality Testing [PLACEHOLDER - NOT YET DEFINED]

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Project Status**: Quality testing procedures are in the planning phase.
> None of the test scenarios below are implemented or finalized.

## Current Status: Planning Phase

This directory will contain our quality testing scenarios and procedures once they are defined.
Currently, no testing methodologies or criteria have been established.

## Planned Testing Categories (Future)

### ‚ôø Accessibility Testing [NOT DEFINED]

- **File**: `accessibility-tests.md` (to be created)

### ‚ö° Performance Testing [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define Core Web Vitals benchmark tests
- Will include component-specific performance validation
- Will specify memory usage testing and leak detection
- Will include animation smoothness and interaction response tests
- **File**: `performance-benchmarks.md` (to be created)

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Interaction Testing [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define desktop-specific interaction test scenarios at 1920√ó1080
- Will include mouse, keyboard, and focus management tests
- Will specify complex component interaction validation
- Will include cross-browser compatibility testing procedures
- **File**: `desktop-interaction-tests.md` (to be created)

### üåê Cross-Browser Testing [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define browser compatibility test matrix
- Will include visual regression testing procedures
- Will specify functionality testing across supported browsers
- Will include automated cross-browser testing scenarios
- **File**: `cross-browser-tests.md` (to be created)

### üì± Responsive Testing [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define responsive design validation tests
- Will include breakpoint testing and layout verification
- Will specify touch interaction testing for hybrid devices
- Will include viewport-specific performance validation
- **File**: `responsive-tests.md` (to be created)

### üîß Integration Testing [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define component integration test scenarios
- Will include API interaction testing procedures
- Will specify data flow and state management validation
- Will include end-to-end workflow testing
- **File**: `integration-tests.md` (to be created)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Establish testing methodology and framework choices
- [ ] Define test environment setup and configuration requirements
- [ ] Create automated testing pipeline architecture
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarks and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Define accessibility testing procedures and tools
- [ ] Set up cross-browser testing infrastructure

## Contributing

When ready to establish quality testing procedures:

1. **Select testing frameworks** and automation tools based on project needs
2. **Create individual test scenario files** for each testing category
3. **Define specific test cases** with clear pass/fail criteria
4. **Implement automated testing** where possible for regression prevention
5. **Establish manual testing procedures** for subjective quality aspects
6. **Update project status** when testing procedures are approved and implemented

## Testing Infrastructure (Future)

```
quality/testing/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accessibility-tests.md (WCAG compliance test scenarios)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance-benchmarks.md (speed and efficiency tests)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ desktop-interaction-tests.md (desktop-specific interaction tests)

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ responsive-tests.md (responsive design validation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration-tests.md (component integration scenarios)
```

## Testing Tools (To Be Selected)

### Potential Testing Framework Options

- **Automation**: Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or custom metrics
- **Accessibility**: axe-core, Pa11y, or Lighthouse accessibility audit
- **Visual Regression**: Percy, Chromatic, or screenshot comparison
- **Cross-Browser**: BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, or local device testing

### Testing Environment Requirements

- **Consistent Environment**: Containerized testing setup
- **Performance Testing**: Controlled hardware and network conditions
- **Cross-Browser Matrix**: Defined browser versions and operating systems
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Do not implement test scenarios or establish testing procedures based on placeholder content.
Wait for official testing methodologies to be researched, defined, and approved by the project team.
