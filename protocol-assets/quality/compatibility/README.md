# Compatibility Standards [PLACEHOLDER - NOT YET DEFINED]

> ⚠️ **Project Status**: Compatibility standards are in the planning phase.
> None of the specifications below are implemented or finalized.

## Current Status: Planning Phase

This directory will contain our compatibility standards and validation rules once they are defined.
Currently, no compatibility criteria have been established.

## Planned Compatibility Standards (Future)

### 🌐 Browser Compatibility [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define supported browser versions and testing matrix
- Will include polyfill requirements and fallback strategies
- Will specify cross-browser testing procedures
- **File**: `browser-compatibility.md` (to be created)

### 📱 Device Compatibility [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define supported device types and screen resolutions
- Will include mobile and tablet compatibility requirements
- Will specify responsive design validation criteria
- **File**: `device-compatibility.md` (to be created)

### 🖥️ Operating System Compatibility [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define supported operating systems and versions
- Will include OS-specific testing requirements
- Will specify platform-specific optimization standards
- **File**: `os-compatibility.md` (to be created)

### ♿ Assistive Technology Compatibility [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define screen reader and keyboard navigation support
- Will include voice control and switch device compatibility
- Will specify accessibility tool testing procedures
- **File**: `assistive-tech-compatibility.md` (to be created)

### 🔧 Framework Compatibility [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define supported framework versions and dependencies
- Will include backward compatibility requirements
- Will specify migration and upgrade standards
- **File**: `framework-compatibility.md` (to be created)

### 🌍 Internationalization Compatibility [NOT DEFINED]

- Will define language support and locale requirements
- Will include right-to-left text and character encoding standards
- Will specify cultural adaptation and localization criteria
- **File**: `i18n-compatibility.md` (to be created)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Establish baseline compatibility requirements for the project
- [ ] Define browser support matrix based on user analytics
- [ ] Set device compatibility standards for target audience
- [ ] Create OS compatibility testing procedures
- [ ] Establish assistive technology support levels
- [ ] Define framework version compatibility policies

## Contributing

When ready to establish compatibility standards:

1. **Assess target audience** and establish baseline compatibility requirements
2. **Create individual compatibility files** for each compatibility area
3. **Define measurable criteria** with specific support levels and testing procedures
4. **Implement validation tools** for automated compatibility checking
5. **Update project status** when standards are approved and implemented

## File Structure (Future)

```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not implement compatibility validation or establish testing criteria based on placeholder content.
Wait for official compatibility standards to be researched, defined, and approved by the project team.
