```

## Components

### Documentation (`docs/`)

Backend-specific technical documentation:

- API design patterns and guidelines
- Database schema and migration documentation
- Server configuration and deployment guides
- Security implementation and authentication patterns

**Purpose:**

- Support backend development best practices
- Document API contracts and specifications
- Maintain infrastructure and deployment knowledge
- Ensure consistent backend patterns across features

### Testing (`testing/`)

Backend testing protocols and scenarios:

- Unit testing strategies and patterns
- Integration testing scenarios
- API testing and validation protocols
- Performance testing guidelines and benchmarks

**Purpose:**

- Ensure backend code quality and reliability
- Standardize testing approaches across services
- Validate API contracts and integrations
- Monitor performance and scalability

### Workflows (`workflows/`)

Backend development workflows and automation:

- CI/CD pipelines for backend services
- Database migration and deployment workflows
- API versioning and release management
- Monitoring and alerting automation

**Purpose:**

- Automate backend development lifecycle
- Ensure consistent deployment processes
- Manage API versioning and backwards compatibility
- Maintain service reliability and monitoring

## Team Integration

The backend assets integrate with:

- **Shared**: Common standards and board management
- **Frontend**: API contracts and integration patterns
- **Content**: Technical documentation and architecture guides
- **Quality**: Code standards and testing protocols

## Contributing

When adding backend assets:

1. **Documentation**: Focus on API contracts, patterns, and infrastructure
2. **Testing**: Include comprehensive test scenarios for all services
3. **Workflows**: Ensure automation supports team velocity and quality
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related frontend integration patterns

## Maintenance

- Regular API documentation updates and contract validation
- Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
- Database schema evolution tracking and migration management
- Infrastructure updates and security patch management

## Lerian Protocol Integration

Backend assets work with the Lerian Protocol installation system:

- **Profile-Based Installation** - Backend assets installed only with backend or full profiles
- **Agent Integration** - Backend-specific agents for API development and database management (structure ready)
- **MCP Server Support** - Enhanced capabilities through Context7 and other MCP integrations
- **Cross-Domain Standards** - Leverage shared quality standards and testing protocols
