# Backend Workflows

Backend development workflows and automation for continuous integration, deployment, and service management.

## Contents

This directory contains backend-specific workflow definitions and automation including:

### CI/CD Pipeline Workflows

- Automated build and test execution workflows
- Database migration and deployment automation
- Service deployment and rollback procedures
- Environment-specific configuration management

### Development Workflows

- Code review and quality assurance processes
- Feature branch and merge strategies
- Database schema change management workflows
- Service dependency management and updates

### Monitoring & Operations Workflows

- Health check and monitoring automation
- Log aggregation and alert management workflows
- Performance monitoring and automated scaling
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Security & Compliance Workflows

- Automated security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Compliance validation and audit trail generation
- Secret management and rotation workflows
- Access control and permission management automation

## Workflow Organization

Workflows are organized by:

- **Lifecycle Stage**: Development, testing, staging, production
- **Service Type**: API services, background jobs, database operations
- **Automation Level**: Fully automated, semi-automated, manual procedures
- **Trigger Type**: Event-driven, scheduled, manual execution

## YAML Workflow Definitions

All workflows follow standardized YAML formats including:

- **Trigger Conditions**: When and how workflows are initiated
- **Step Dependencies**: Sequential and parallel execution patterns
- **Error Handling**: Failure scenarios and recovery procedures
- **Notification Systems**: Status updates and alert mechanisms

## Contributing

When adding backend workflows:

1. **Clear Documentation**: Include purpose, triggers, and expected outcomes
2. **Error Handling**: Define comprehensive error scenarios and recovery
3. **Testing**: Validate workflows in non-production environments first
4. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing automation systems

## Integration Points

Backend workflows integrate with:

- **Frontend Workflows**: Coordinated deployment and testing procedures
- **Shared Standards**: Common CI/CD practices and quality gates
- **Quality Protocols**: Automated testing and validation requirements
