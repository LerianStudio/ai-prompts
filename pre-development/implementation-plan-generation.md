# Implementation Plan Generation

**Role**: Senior Engineering Manager & Technical Project Lead  
**Goal**: Generate detailed implementation plans for LerianStudio plugins following established delivery patterns  
**Session ID**: Use repository-specific session for context tracking

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED**: This prompt should be executed AFTER both PRD and TRD have been generated and approved. The Implementation Plan translates business and technical requirements into executable development phases.

**Reference Standards**: Base all implementation patterns on existing LerianStudio plugins:
- `../plugin-scheduler/docs/pre-development-docs/`
- `../plugin-event-streamer/docs/pre-development-docs/`
- `../plugin-spending-control/docs/pre-development-docs/`

**Input Requirements**:
- Completed PRD with business requirements and success criteria
- Completed TRD with technical architecture and specifications
- Development team capacity and timeline constraints
- Business priority and release requirements

## Critical Instructions

### 🔍 **STEP 1: PROJECT SCOPING & PLANNING ANALYSIS**

Before generating the implementation plan, analyze the PRD/TRD and ask project planning questions:

#### **Development Context Questions**
1. **Team & Resources**
   - What is the development team size and composition?
   - What are the skill levels and experience with Go/LerianStudio stack?
   - Are there any team members with domain expertise for this plugin?
   - What is the available development capacity (hours per week)?

2. **Timeline & Priorities**
   - What are the business deadlines and critical milestones?
   - Are there any external dependencies or constraints?
   - What is the minimum viable product (MVP) scope?
   - Which features are must-have vs. nice-to-have for initial release?

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - What are the highest technical risks based on the TRD?
   - Are there any unknowns that need prototyping or research?
   - What external integrations pose the highest risk?
   - Which performance targets are most challenging to achieve?

4. **Quality & Testing Strategy**
   - What testing approach should be followed?
   - Are there specific quality gates that must be met?
   - What performance testing requirements exist?
   - How should documentation be maintained throughout development?

5. **Deployment & Operations**
   - What is the deployment strategy (staging, production, rollback)?
   - Are there any operational requirements during development?
   - How should monitoring and observability be implemented progressively?
   - What backup and disaster recovery considerations exist?

type Service interface {
    CreateEntity(ctx context.Context, req CreateRequest) (*Entity, error)
    GetEntity(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Entity, error)
}

// Dependency injection
func NewService(repo Repository, cache Cache, logger Logger) Service {
    return &service{repo: repo, cache: cache, logger: logger}
}

// Error handling
func (s *service) CreateEntity(ctx context.Context, req CreateRequest) (*Entity, error) {
    if err := validateRequest(req); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid request: %w", err)
    }
    
    entity, err := s.repo.Create(ctx, req)
    if err != nil {
        s.logger.Error("failed to create entity", "error", err)
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create entity: %w", err)
    }
    
    return entity, nil
}
```

#### **Testing Standards**
```go
// Unit test structure
func TestService_CreateEntity(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        request CreateRequest
        want    *Entity
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // Test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}

// Integration test setup
func setupTestEnvironment(t *testing.T) (*TestEnv, func()) {
    db := setupTestDB(t)
    cache := setupTestCache(t)
    service := NewService(db, cache, testLogger)
    
    cleanup := func() {
        db.Close()
