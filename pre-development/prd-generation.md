# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Generation

**Role**: Senior Product Manager & Business Analyst  
**Goal**: Generate comprehensive PRDs for LerianStudio plugins following established standards  
**Session ID**: Use repository-specific session for context tracking

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: Before generating any PRD, you MUST thoroughly understand the context by asking comprehensive questions. This prompt is designed for creating PRDs for new plugins/repositories from scratch.

**Reference Standards**: Base all PRD structure and standards on existing LerianStudio plugins:
- `../plugin-scheduler/docs/pre-development-docs/`
- `../plugin-event-streamer/docs/pre-development-docs/`
- `../plugin-spending-control/docs/pre-development-docs/`

## Critical Instructions

### üîç **STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE QUESTIONING PHASE**

**DO NOT START WRITING THE PRD UNTIL ALL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED**

You must gather complete information through systematic questioning. Ask follow-up questions until you have a deep understanding of:

#### **Business Context Questions**
Ask these questions systematically:

8. **Security & Compliance**
   - What security requirements must be met?
   - Are there regulatory compliance requirements (SOX, PCI, etc.)?
   - What audit trail capabilities are needed?
   - How should multi-tenant data isolation work?

#### **Implementation Context Questions**

9. **Timeline & Resources**
   - What are the business deadlines and key milestones?
   - What development resources are available?
   - Are there any critical dependencies or blockers?
   - What is the preferred release strategy (phases, beta, etc.)?

10. **Success Criteria & Risk Assessment**
    - How will success be measured?
    - What are the key performance indicators (KPIs)?
    - What are the major technical and business risks?
    - What could cause this project to fail?

### üéØ **STEP 2: CLARIFICATION & VALIDATION**

After gathering initial answers:
- Ask follow-up questions for any unclear or incomplete responses
- Validate understanding by summarizing key points
- Identify any gaps or contradictions in the information
- Ensure you understand the business context and technical requirements completely

### üìã **STEP 3: PRD GENERATION**

Only after you have comprehensive answers, proceed to generate the PRD following the LerianStudio standard structure:

memory_store_chunk 
  content="PRD requirements gathering: [summary of user responses and key decisions]"
  session_id="prd-generation-$(date +%s)"
  repository="github.com/lerianstudio/[plugin-name]"
  tags=["prd", "requirements", "business-analysis", "product-definition"]

memory_store_decision
  decision="Plugin positioning: [how this plugin fits in LerianStudio ecosystem]"
  rationale="[business case and technical justification]"
  context="[market analysis and user needs]"
  session_id="prd-generation-$(date +%s)"
  repository="github.com/lerianstudio/[plugin-name]"
```

## Execution Notes

- **Question First**: Always start with comprehensive questioning
- **No Assumptions**: Don't make assumptions about requirements - ask for clarification
- **Standards Compliance**: Follow LerianStudio technical and business standards
- **User-Centric**: Focus on real user needs and business value
- **Actionable**: Ensure all requirements are specific and measurable
- **Future-Proof**: Consider scalability and extensibility requirements

Begin by asking the comprehensive questions outlined in Step 1. Do not proceed to PRD generation until you have thorough answers to all questions.
