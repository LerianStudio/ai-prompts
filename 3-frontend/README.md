# 3-frontend: Complete Frontend Development Workflow

## Overview

The **3-frontend** workflow is a comprehensive system for frontend development that handles flexible design inputs (from iPad sketches to Figma designs) and creates atomic, human-reviewable implementation tasks optimized for **human-AI pair programming**.

## When to Use This Workflow

### ✅ Perfect for:
- **Frontend features** with any level of design input (sketches, Figma, wireframes, references)
- **UI components** that need systematic breakdown into implementable tasks
- **Integration with existing BFF/backend** systems and APIs
- **Human-AI pair programming** scenarios requiring clear task boundaries
- **Atomic commit workflows** for easy code review and validation
- **Design-to-code projects** requiring high design fidelity
- **Component library development** with systematic architecture

### ❌ Use other workflows for:
- **Complete product development** → Use `1-pre-dev-product`
- **Quick feature additions to existing systems** → Use `2-pre-dev-feature`
- **Backend-only development** → Use `1-pre-dev-product`
- **Code review and analysis** → Use `3-code-review`

## Key Workflow Advantages

### 🎨 Design Flexibility
- **Handles any design input:** iPad sketches, Figma designs, written specs, reference apps
- **Fills design gaps systematically:** AI suggests missing specifications based on design systems
- **Iterative design refinement:** Built-in user feedback loops for design iteration

## Best Practices

### For Development Teams
1. **Systematic Approach:** Follow all phases for complex features, adapt for simpler ones
2. **Design Iteration:** Embrace design iteration in Phase 1 for better outcomes
3. **Architecture Investment:** Invest time in Phase 3 for long-term maintainability
4. **Human-AI Balance:** Use AI for systematic breakdown, human for creative validation
5. **Quality Gates:** Never skip validation phases for production deployments

### For Solo Developers
1. **Iterative Development:** Use phases iteratively for complex features
2. **Context Management:** Leverage Memory MCP for solo development continuity
3. **Quality Maintenance:** Use validation phases to maintain high code quality
4. **Pattern Building:** Build personal library of successful patterns and components

### For Design-Heavy Projects
1. **Design Input Flexibility:** Start with whatever design input is available
2. **Gap Filling Strategy:** Use AI to systematically fill design specification gaps
3. **Iteration Loops:** Plan for multiple design iteration cycles
4. **Fidelity Validation:** Use Phase 5 to ensure design intent is preserved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Design input is too vague or incomplete"**
- Phase 1 is specifically designed for this - it systematically identifies gaps
- Use Sequential Thinking MCP for complex design interpretation
- Leverage existing design system patterns to fill gaps
- Iterate with user feedback to clarify design intent

**"Component architecture seems too complex"**
- Review component boundaries in Phase 3
- Consider breaking large components into smaller, focused components
- Use existing component patterns from design system
- Validate complexity against implementation team capacity

**"Tasks are too large for single sessions"**
- Revisit task boundaries in Phase 4
- Apply atomic task principles more strictly (2-4 hour maximum)
- Break integration points into separate tasks
- Consider file size limits when defining task scope

**"Integration with existing system is unclear"**
- Use Memory MCP to retrieve more architectural context in Phase 2
- Focus on integration points in Phase 3 component design
- Ask more specific technical questions about existing patterns
- Reference existing component implementations for consistency

**"Performance requirements not being met"**
- Review performance strategy in Phase 2
- Build performance optimization into Phase 3 component design
- Add specific performance tasks in Phase 4
- Use Phase 5 to validate performance against benchmarks

## Advanced Usage

### Complex Feature Development
For features requiring extensive design work or complex integration:
1. **Extended Design Phase:** Spend additional time in Phase 1 for design iteration
2. **Architecture Prototyping:** Create quick prototypes in Phase 3 for validation
3. **Incremental Implementation:** Break Phase 4 into multiple implementation cycles
4. **Continuous Validation:** Use Phase 5 iteratively throughout development

### Team Collaboration
For team-based development:
1. **Shared Context:** Use Memory MCP for team knowledge sharing
2. **Parallel Development:** Assign different atomic tasks to different team members
3. **Integration Coordination:** Use Phase 3 architecture as coordination foundation
4. **Quality Standards:** Use Phase 5 validation as team quality gate

### Legacy System Integration
For integration with existing systems:
1. **System Analysis:** Use Memory MCP to understand existing architecture
2. **Integration Strategy:** Focus Phase 2 on integration rather than new development
3. **Migration Planning:** Use Phase 4 to plan incremental migration tasks
4. **Compatibility Validation:** Extend Phase 5 for legacy system compatibility
