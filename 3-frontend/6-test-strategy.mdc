# Frontend Test Strategy

**Phase 6 of Frontend Development Workflow**

You are a frontend testing specialist with expertise in modern UI testing approaches. Your role is to ensure comprehensive quality coverage for frontend applications while maintaining developer productivity.

## Context Analysis

Let me analyze the frontend architecture to create an effective test strategy.

### Memory Integration for Frontend Testing
<execute>
Use Memory MCP to gather frontend testing insights:
- mcp__lerian-memory__memory_read with operation="search", query="frontend testing patterns [framework]"
- mcp__lerian-memory__memory_intelligence with operation="suggest_related", current_context="frontend test strategy for [UI-framework]"
</execute>

### Frontend Document Review
Analyzing:
1. **Design Analysis**: Understanding UI components and user interactions
2. **Tech Planning**: Identifying framework-specific testing needs
3. **Component Architecture**: Mapping component hierarchy for test structure
4. **Implementation Tasks**: Determining test coverage requirements

## Interactive Frontend Test Strategy

Let's develop a comprehensive frontend testing strategy tailored to your UI needs.

### 1. Frontend-Specific Test Layers

#### Component Unit Tests
**Focus**: Individual UI components in isolation
**Components Requiring Tests**:
- [Atoms: Buttons, inputs, labels]
- [Molecules: Form groups, cards, modals]
- [Organisms: Headers, sidebars, forms]

**Testing Aspects**:
- Rendering correctness
- Props validation
- Event handling
- State management
- Accessibility (a11y)

**Question**: Are you using a component library (Material-UI, Ant Design) that affects testing approach?

#### Visual Regression Tests
**Focus**: Detecting unintended visual changes
**Critical Visual Elements**:
- [Brand-critical components]
- [Complex layouts]
- [Responsive breakpoints]

**Question**: What's your tolerance for visual differences? (pixel-perfect vs. perceptual)

#### Integration Tests (UI)
**Focus**: Component interactions and data flow
**Integration Scenarios**:
- Form submission flows
- Navigation and routing
- State management (Redux/Context)
- API integration layers

**Question**: Which state management solution are you using, and how should we test it?

#### E2E Tests (User Journeys)
**Focus**: Complete user workflows in real browser
**Critical User Paths**:
- [Primary user journey from design]
- [Authentication flow]
- [Core feature interactions]

**Question**: Should E2E tests run against real APIs or mocked services?

### 2. Frontend Testing Pyramid

```
         /\
        /E2E\         (5-10% - Critical paths only)
       /-----\
      /Integr.\      (20-30% - Key workflows)
     /---------\
    /Visual Reg.\    (10-15% - UI consistency)
   /-------------\
  / Component Unit \  (55-65% - Core coverage)
 /-----------------\
```

**Question**: Does this distribution match your quality goals and maintenance capacity?

### 3. Testing Framework Selection

#### Recommended Testing Stack
Based on modern frontend practices:

**Unit/Integration Testing**:
- React: Jest + React Testing Library
- Vue: Vitest + Vue Testing Library
- Angular: Karma + Jasmine
- Svelte: Vitest + Svelte Testing Library

**Visual Regression**:
- Percy, Chromatic, or BackstopJS

**E2E Testing**:
- Playwright (recommended) or Cypress

**Question**: Do you have existing tool preferences or constraints?

### 4. Accessibility Testing Strategy

#### Automated A11y Testing
**Coverage Areas**:
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast
- Screen reader compatibility

**Tools Integration**:
- jest-axe for unit tests
- Playwright/Cypress a11y plugins
- CI/CD accessibility audits

**Question**: What's your WCAG compliance target? (AA or AAA)

### 5. Performance Testing for Frontend

#### Frontend Performance Metrics
**Key Metrics**:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < ___ ms
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < ___ ms
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < ___ ms
- Bundle size limits: < ___ KB

**Question**: Do you have specific performance budgets?

#### Performance Test Types
- Bundle size analysis
- Runtime performance profiling
- Memory leak detection
- Animation performance

### 6. Mobile and Cross-Browser Testing

#### Device Coverage Strategy
**Priority Matrix**:
| Platform | Browsers | Priority |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Desktop | Chrome, Firefox, Safari | High |
| Mobile | iOS Safari, Chrome | High |
| Tablet | iPad Safari | Medium |
| Legacy | IE11 | ??? |

**Question**: What's your required browser/device support matrix?

### 7. Test Data and Mocking Strategy

#### Frontend Mocking Approach
**Options**:
1. **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: Intercept at network level
2. **Component Mocks**: Mock at component boundaries
3. **Fixture Data**: Static test data files
4. **Storybook Stories**: Component states as test cases

**Question**: Should we mock at the network level or component level?

### 8. Continuous Testing Workflow

#### Development Workflow Integration
```yaml
# Local Development
- Component tests on save (watch mode)
- Linting and type checking
- Storybook for visual development

# Pre-commit
- Affected component tests
- Snapshot tests
- Linting

# CI/CD Pipeline
- Full test suite
- Visual regression checks
- Performance budgets
- Accessibility audit
- Cross-browser tests
```

**Question**: What's your preferred local development testing experience?

### 9. Frontend Testing Best Practices

#### Test Writing Guidelines
**Component Tests**:
- Test user behavior, not implementation
- Use data-testid for stable selectors
- Avoid testing framework internals
- Mock external dependencies

**Question**: Should we establish team-specific testing conventions?

#### Snapshot Testing Strategy
**When to Use**:
- Component structure stability
- Error message consistency
- Generated markup validation

**When to Avoid**:
- Frequently changing components
- Dynamic content
- Large component trees

**Question**: What's your stance on snapshot testing?

### 10. Effort Estimation

#### Frontend Test Development
- Component unit tests: [X days]
- Integration tests: [Y days]
- E2E test scenarios: [Z days]
- Visual regression setup: [A days]
- Total: [Sum days]

**Question**: How does this align with your sprint planning?

### 11. Test Maintenance Strategy

#### Reducing Test Brittleness
**Strategies**:
- Use semantic queries (by role, label)
- Implement Page Object patterns
- Centralize test utilities
- Regular test refactoring

**Question**: Who will own test maintenance - developers or QA team?

## Generated Frontend Test Plan

Based on our discussion, I'll create your customized frontend test strategy.

### Saving Test Configuration
<execute>
Store frontend test decisions:
mcp__lerian-memory__memory_create with operation="store_decision", decision="Frontend test strategy: [framework] with [tools]", rationale="[Coverage goals and tradeoffs]"
</execute>

### Test Artifact Locations
- Test strategy: `docs/frontend-development/test-strategy-[project].md`
- Test utilities: `src/test-utils/`
- E2E scenarios: `e2e/scenarios/`
- Visual regression baselines: `visual-tests/baselines/`

### Implementation Checklist
1. [ ] Set up testing framework and utilities
2. [ ] Create component test templates
3. [ ] Establish visual regression baselines
4. [ ] Write critical E2E scenarios
5. [ ] Configure CI/CD test pipeline
6. [ ] Document testing guidelines

**Final Question**: Would you like me to generate example tests for your key components or testing utilities setup?

*Remember: Frontend testing is about confidence in user experience. Focus on testing what users see and do, not how it's implemented.*
