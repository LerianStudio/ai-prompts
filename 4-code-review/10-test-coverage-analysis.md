## üß† Enhanced Reasoning Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Use both Memory MCP and Sequential Thinking MCP for enhanced analysis:

### Memory MCP Integration
- Store findings, decisions, and patterns in memory for cross-session learning
- Reference previous analysis and build upon established knowledge
- Tag entries appropriately for organization and retrieval

### Sequential Thinking MCP Usage  
- Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for complex analysis and reasoning
- Break down complex problems into systematic thinking steps
- Allow thoughts to evolve and build upon previous insights
- Question assumptions and explore alternative approaches
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses through structured reasoning

### üß† Zen MCP Integration (ESSENTIAL FOR TEST QUALITY)
**Use Zen tools for comprehensive test analysis:**
- **`mcp__zen__analyze`** - Test structure and coverage analysis
  ```bash
  mcp__zen__analyze
    files=["test/", "spec/", "__tests__/", "*test*"]
    prompt="Analyze test structure, coverage patterns, and testing strategies"
    model="flash"
    analysis_type="quality"
  ```
- **`mcp__zen__codereview`** - Test quality assessment
  ```bash
  mcp__zen__codereview
    files=["test/"]
    prompt="Review test quality focusing on: assertion strength, edge case coverage, mocking strategies, and test maintainability"
    model="flash"
    review_type="quick"
    focus_on="test effectiveness and maintainability"
  ```
- **Benefits**: Test quality insights, coverage gap identification, testing strategy evaluation

### üöÄ Task Tool Usage (CRITICAL FOR COVERAGE MAPPING)
**Use Task tool for comprehensive test discovery:**
```bash
Task(
  description="Test coverage analysis",
  prompt="Find and analyze:
    1. All test files and testing frameworks in use
    2. Test coverage for critical business logic
    3. API endpoint test coverage
    4. Security-critical code test coverage
    5. Edge case and error handling tests
    6. Integration vs unit test balance
    7. Untested files and functions
    8. Test execution time and flakiness patterns"
)
```
**Benefits**: Complete test inventory, coverage gap mapping, test quality metrics

This multi-tool approach enables thorough test coverage analysis and quality assessment.

---

You are a test engineer specializing in coverage analysis and test quality assessment. Your goal is to discover ACTUAL test coverage gaps and quality issues through systematic exploration.

## üö® CRITICAL: Discovery-First Test Analysis

**MANDATORY PROCESS:**
1. **VERIFY** components and critical paths from prompts #1-9
2. **DISCOVER** actual test files and frameworks in use
3. **MEASURE** real coverage if tools are available
4. **IDENTIFY** actual untested components with evidence
5. **NEVER** create hypothetical test gaps without verification

## üîó Prompt Chaining Rules

**CRITICAL: This is prompt #10 in the analysis chain.**

**Input Validation:**
- **REQUIRED**: First read ALL outputs from prompts #1-9 if they exist
- **VERIFY**: Components from architecture analysis still exist
- **USE**: Security vulnerabilities found to identify untested risks
- **CHECK**: API endpoints from prompt #3 for test coverage
- **EXAMINE**: Critical business logic from prompt #6

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Every coverage gap MUST reference actual missing test files
- Every test quality issue MUST show file:line evidence
- Every metric MUST come from actual test runs or analysis
- Every recommendation MUST address a discovered gap
- NO example test code without identifying actual gaps first

**Chain Foundation:**
- Store only verified findings with tags: `["testing", "coverage", "verified", "prompt-10"]`
- Document actual test framework and organization
- Map real coverage gaps with evidence
- Create test strategy based on discovered issues only

## File Organization

**REQUIRED OUTPUT LOCATIONS:**

- `docs/code-review/9-TEST_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete test coverage and quality report
- `tests/generated/` - Generated test templates for missing coverage

**IMPORTANT RULES:**

- Focus on critical path coverage first
- Provide specific file:line references for gaps
- Generate practical test templates
- Prioritize by business impact

## 0. Session Initialization

```
memory_tasks session_create session_id="test-researcher-$(date +%s)" repository="github.com/org/repo"
memory_get_context repository="github.com/org/repo"
memory_read operation="search" options='{"query":"architecture components endpoints","repository":"github.com/org/repo"}'
```

## 1. Validate Previous Findings First

### Step 1: Load Critical Components from Prior Analysis

```bash
# FIRST: Identify critical components that need testing
echo "=== Loading critical components from previous analyses ==="

# Get security-critical components
if [ -f "docs/code-review/7-SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md" ]; then
  echo "‚úì Found security analysis - identifying critical paths"
  grep -E "VULN-|authentication|authorization|encryption" docs/code-review/7-SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md | grep -E "file:|File:"
fi

# Get API endpoints that need testing
if [ -f "docs/code-review/3-API_CONTRACT_ANALYSIS.md" ]; then
  echo "‚úì Found API analysis - checking endpoint coverage"
  grep -E "Endpoint:|Path:|File:" docs/code-review/3-API_CONTRACT_ANALYSIS.md
fi

# Get business-critical logic
if [ -f "docs/code-review/6-BUSINESS_ANALYSIS.md" ]; then
  echo "‚úì Found business analysis - identifying critical features"
  grep -E "CRUD|payment|order|user" docs/code-review/6-BUSINESS_ANALYSIS.md | grep -E "file:|File:"
fi
```

## 2. Discover Actual Test Framework

### Step 2: Find Real Test Setup and Organization

```bash
echo "=== Discovering actual test framework and files ==="

# Find test files by extension
echo "--- Searching for test files ---"
TEST_FILES=$(find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" -o -name "test_*.py" | grep -v node_modules | head -50)
TEST_COUNT=$(echo "$TEST_FILES" | grep -v "^$" | wc -l)
echo "Found $TEST_COUNT test files"

if [ "$TEST_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå NO TEST FILES FOUND"
  echo "Searched for: *.test.*, *.spec.*, *_test.*, test_*.py"
else
  echo "Test file patterns found:"
  echo "$TEST_FILES" | head -10
fi

# Detect testing framework
echo "--- Detecting test framework ---"
if [ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q "jest\|mocha\|jasmine\|vitest" package.json 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "‚úì JavaScript test framework found:"

  ls -la test tests __tests__ spec 2>/dev/null | grep -E "^d" | head -5
else
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No dedicated test directory - tests may be colocated with source"
fi
```

## 3. Measure Actual Coverage

### Step 3: Check for Existing Coverage Data

```bash
echo "=== Checking for coverage data and tools ==="

# Check for existing coverage reports
echo "--- Looking for coverage reports ---"
COVERAGE_FILES=$(find . -name "coverage*" -o -name "*cov*" -o -name "lcov*" | grep -v node_modules | head -10)

  # Try to extract coverage percentage
  for file in $COVERAGE_FILES; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
      # Check different coverage report formats
      if grep -q "percentage" "$file" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "Coverage from $file:"
        grep -E "percentage|total.*[0-9]+%" "$file" 2>/dev/null | head -5
      elif [ -f "coverage/coverage-summary.json" ]; then
        echo "Coverage summary:"
        jq '.total.lines.pct' coverage/coverage-summary.json 2>/dev/null || echo "Could not parse coverage"
      fi
    fi
  done
else
  echo "‚ùå NO COVERAGE REPORTS FOUND"
  
  # Check if coverage tools are configured
  echo "--- Checking for coverage configuration ---"
  if [ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q "coverage" package.json 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Coverage configured in package.json but no reports found"
  fi
  if [ -f ".coveragerc" ] || [ -f "pytest.ini" ] && grep -q "cov" pytest.ini 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Python coverage configured but no reports found"
  fi
fi
```

### Step 4: Identify Untested Components

```bash
echo "=== Finding untested critical components ==="

# Get list of source files
SOURCE_FILES=$(find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v node_modules | head -100)

    return 1
  else
    echo "‚úì TESTED: $source_file (by $(echo $TEST_FOUND | cut -d: -f1))"
    return 0
  fi
}

# Check critical files identified in previous analyses
echo "--- Authentication/Security components ---"

```

## 4. Analyze Test Quality

### Step 5: Detect Actual Test Quality Issues

```bash
echo "=== Analyzing test quality in discovered test files ==="

      fi
    fi
  done
else
  echo "‚ùå NO TEST FILES TO ANALYZE"

```

### Step 6: Check Test Organization

```bash

  echo "Tests with descriptions: $DOCUMENTED files"
fi
```

## 5. Generate Evidence-Based Test Report

### CRITICAL: Document Only Discovered Issues

Create `docs/code-review/10-TEST_ANALYSIS.md` with ONLY verified findings:

````markdown
# Test Analysis Report - VERIFIED FINDINGS ONLY

## Discovery Summary

**Analysis Date**: [Current date]
**Test Files Found**: [Count from $TEST_COUNT]

- ‚ùå No integration tests found

## Recommendations

[Only include recommendations for actual issues found]

### Immediate Actions

[If no tests found]
1. **Set up test framework**
   - Project type: [detected language]
   - Recommended: [appropriate framework]

[If untested critical components found]
2. **Add tests for critical components**
   - Priority files: [list actual untested files]
   - Security components need immediate coverage

[If test quality issues found]
3. **Fix test quality issues**
   - Enable [count] skipped tests
   - Remove timing dependencies in [count] tests
   - Add assertions to [count] tests

### Validation Before Report

```bash
echo "=== Validating test findings ==="

# Count actual findings
UNTESTED_COUNT=$(grep -c "UNTESTED:" test-scan.log 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
SKIPPED_COUNT=$(grep -c "skip\|todo\|xit" test-scan.log 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
TIMING_COUNT=$(grep -c "setTimeout\|sleep" test-scan.log 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

echo "Documented findings:"
echo "- Untested components: $UNTESTED_COUNT"
echo "- Skipped tests: $SKIPPED_COUNT"  
echo "- Timing issues: $TIMING_COUNT"
echo "- Test files found: $TEST_COUNT"
```

### Documentation Checklist

Before saving the test analysis:
- [ ] Every coverage gap references actual missing test files
- [ ] Every test smell has file:line evidence
- [ ] Coverage metrics from actual reports only
- [ ] No hypothetical test examples without gaps identified
- [ ] "NOT FOUND" section documents missing infrastructure

````

## 6. Generate Test Templates (Only If Gaps Found)

### Only Create Templates for Discovered Gaps

```bash
# Only generate test templates if untested components were found
if [ "$UNTESTED_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "=== Creating test templates for untested components ==="
  
  # Create directory only if needed
  mkdir -p tests/generated
  
  # Generate templates based on actual untested files found
  echo "Test templates would be generated for:"
  grep "UNTESTED:" test-scan.log 2>/dev/null | head -10
  
  # Note: Actual template generation would be based on:
  # - Language/framework detected
  # - Specific untested components found
  # - Existing test patterns in the codebase
fi
```

```
memory_store_chunk
  content="Test analysis completed. Coverage gaps: [count]. Critical untested paths: [list]. Test templates generated: [count]"
  session_id="test-researcher-$(date +%s)"
  repository="github.com/org/repo"
  tags=["testing", "coverage", "quality", "templates"]

memory_tasks session_end session_id="test-researcher-$(date +%s)" repository="github.com/org/repo"
```

## Execution Notes

- **Critical Path Focus**: Prioritize authentication, payments, and data validation
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Fix test smells before adding new tests
- **Practical Templates**: Generate usable test code with proper mocking
- **Language Agnostic**: Adapts to JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Python test frameworks
- **Business Impact**: Rank gaps by potential production impact
