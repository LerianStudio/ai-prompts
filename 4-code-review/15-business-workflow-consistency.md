## üß† Enhanced Reasoning Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Use both Memory MCP and Sequential Thinking MCP for enhanced analysis:

### Memory MCP Integration
- Store findings, decisions, and patterns in memory for cross-session learning
- Reference previous analysis and build upon established knowledge
- Tag entries appropriately for organization and retrieval

### Sequential Thinking MCP Usage  
- Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for complex analysis and reasoning
- Break down complex problems into systematic thinking steps
- Allow thoughts to evolve and build upon previous insights
- Question assumptions and explore alternative approaches
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses through structured reasoning

This approach enables deeper analysis, better pattern recognition, and more thorough problem-solving capabilities.

### Zen MCP Integration
Use Zen MCP tools for comprehensive business workflow analysis:

**1. Business Process Deep Analysis:**
```bash
mcp__zen__thinkdeep \
  prompt="Analyze the entire business workflow from user perspective. Map user journeys, identify decision points, validate data flow consistency, and find gaps in process implementation." \
  files=["/services", "/workflows", "/state-machines", "/api", "/models"] \
  model="pro" \
  thinking_mode="max" \
  focus_areas=["user journey", "state transitions", "data consistency", "error recovery", "business rules"]
```

**2. Workflow Consistency Review:**
```bash
mcp__zen__codereview \
  files=["/workflows", "/processes", "/services/**/*.js", "/handlers"] \
  prompt="Review business workflow implementations for consistency, completeness, and error handling. Check state transitions, transaction boundaries, and data validation at each step." \
  model="pro" \
  review_type="full" \
  focus_on="workflow completeness, state consistency, error paths, rollback mechanisms"
```

**3. Integration Point Analysis:**
```bash
mcp__zen__analyze \
  files=["/api", "/integrations", "/external-services", "/event-handlers"] \
  prompt="Analyze all integration points in business workflows. Verify data contracts, error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms for external dependencies." \
  model="pro" \
  analysis_type="architecture" \
  output_format="actionable"
```

### Task Tool Usage
Search for business workflow patterns:

```bash
# Find workflow and process implementations
task search "workflow|process|state|status|flow" --context "class|function|service"

# Search for state transitions
task search "setState|updateStatus|transition|changeState|status.*="

# Find business operations
task search "create.*Order|process.*Payment|approve.*|submit.*|complete.*"

# Look for validation rules
task search "validate|validator|validation|rules|business.*rule"

# Find transaction boundaries
task search "transaction|beginTx|commit|rollback|atomic"

# Search for workflow orchestration
task search "orchestrate|coordinate|saga|workflow.*engine"

# Find event-driven patterns
task search "emit|publish|subscribe|event.*handler|on.*event"

# Look for compensation logic
task search "compensate|undo|revert|rollback|reverse"
```

**Benefits:**
- Zen MCP provides holistic business process analysis and validation
- Task tool rapidly discovers workflow implementations and patterns
- Combined approach ensures comprehensive business consistency verification

# Business Workflow Consistency Analysis

You are a product business analyst specializing in discovering ACTUAL business workflows through code analysis. Your goal is to identify real workflows, validate their consistency, and find gaps based on evidence.

## üö® CRITICAL: Discovery-First Workflow Analysis

**MANDATORY PROCESS:**
1. **DISCOVER** actual business workflows in the codebase
2. **TRACE** real user journeys through code paths
3. **VALIDATE** workflow consistency with evidence
4. **IDENTIFY** gaps in business process implementation
5. **NEVER** create hypothetical workflows without code evidence

## üîó Prompt Chaining Rules

**CRITICAL: This is prompt #15 in the analysis chain.**

**Input Validation:**
- **REQUIRED**: First read ALL outputs from prompts #1-14 if they exist
- **VERIFY**: Business processes from prompt #6 still exist
- **USE**: API endpoints from prompt #3 for entry points
- **CHECK**: Database operations from prompt #4 for data flow
- **EXAMINE**: Test scenarios from prompt #10 for coverage

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Every workflow MUST be traced through actual code
- Every state transition MUST have file:line evidence
- Every process gap MUST reference missing implementation
- Every validation MUST show actual business rules
- NO template workflows without code paths

**Chain Foundation:**
- Store only verified findings with tags: `["business-workflow", "consistency", "verified", "prompt-15"]`
- Document actual workflow implementations
- Map real user journeys with evidence
- Create consistency report based on discovered flows

## Core Analysis Framework

### 1. Discover Actual Business Workflows

#### Step 1: Find Real Business Processes

```bash
echo "=== Discovering actual business workflows in codebase ==="

# Find workflow/process implementations
echo "--- Searching for workflow implementations ---"
WORKFLOW_FILES=$(grep -r "workflow\|process\|state\|status" --include="*.{js,ts,go,py,java}" . | grep -v test | grep -v node_modules)
if [ -n "$WORKFLOW_FILES" ]; then
  echo "Workflow references found:"
  echo "$WORKFLOW_FILES" | head -20
  WORKFLOW_COUNT=$(echo "$WORKFLOW_FILES" | wc -l)
  echo "Total workflow references: $WORKFLOW_COUNT"
else
  echo "‚ùå NO WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATIONS FOUND"
fi

# Find state transitions
echo "--- Searching for state transitions ---"
STATE_TRANSITIONS=$(grep -r "setState\|updateStatus\|transition\|changeState" --include="*.{js,ts,go,py}" . | grep -v test | head -20)
if [ -n "$STATE_TRANSITIONS" ]; then
  echo "State transition code found:"
  echo "$STATE_TRANSITIONS"
else
  echo "‚ùå NO STATE TRANSITION CODE FOUND"
fi

# Find business operations
echo "--- Searching for business operations ---"
BUSINESS_OPS=$(grep -r "create.*Order\|process.*Payment\|approve.*Request\|submit.*Application" --include="*.{js,ts,go,py}" . | grep -v test | head -20)
if [ -n "$BUSINESS_OPS" ]; then
  echo "Business operations found:"
  echo "$BUSINESS_OPS"
else
  echo "No standard business operations found - checking for custom operations"
fi
```

### 2. Trace User Journey Entry Points

echo "--- Finding workflow entry points ---"
if [ -f "docs/code-review/3-API_CONTRACT_ANALYSIS.md" ]; then
  echo "Using API analysis from prompt #3..."
  ENTRY_POINTS=$(grep -E "POST|PUT" docs/code-review/3-API_CONTRACT_ANALYSIS.md | grep -E "create|submit|start|initiate")
  echo "Workflow entry points from API analysis:"
  echo "$ENTRY_POINTS"
fi

# Map endpoints to handlers
echo "--- Mapping endpoints to business logic ---"
for endpoint in $(echo "$ENTRY_POINTS" | awk '{print $2}' | head -5); do
  echo "\nTracing endpoint: $endpoint"
  # Find handler for this endpoint
  HANDLER=$(grep -r "$endpoint" --include="*.{js,ts,go,py}" . | grep -E "router|app|handle" | head -1)
  if [ -n "$HANDLER" ]; then
    echo "  Handler found: $HANDLER"
    # Extract the handler function name
    HANDLER_FILE=$(echo "$HANDLER" | cut -d: -f1)
    HANDLER_LINE=$(echo "$HANDLER" | cut -d: -f2)
    echo "  Location: $HANDLER_FILE:$HANDLER_LINE"
  else
    echo "  ‚ùå NO HANDLER FOUND for $endpoint"
  fi
done

# Check authentication requirements

if [ -n "$AUTH_MIDDLEWARE" ]; then
  echo "Authentication middleware found:"
  echo "$AUTH_MIDDLEWARE"
fi
```

### 3. Validate Workflow Data Flow

#### Step 3: Trace Data Requirements Through Workflows

```bash
echo "=== Validating workflow data consistency ==="

# Find validation rules
echo "--- Discovering validation rules ---"
VALIDATION_FILES=$(find . -name "*validat*" -o -name "*schema*" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v test)

    echo "\nChecking $file:"
    # Look for required fields
    REQUIRED_FIELDS=$(grep -n "required\|mandatory" "$file" 2>/dev/null | head -5)
    if [ -n "$REQUIRED_FIELDS" ]; then
      echo "Required fields:"
      echo "$REQUIRED_FIELDS"
    fi
  done
else
  echo "‚ùå NO VALIDATION FILES FOUND"
fi

# Trace data flow through workflow
echo "--- Tracing data through workflow stages ---"
if [ -n "$BUSINESS_OPS" ]; then
  # For each business operation, check data flow
  for op_line in $(echo "$BUSINESS_OPS" | head -3 | cut -d: -f1,2); do
    FILE=$(echo "$op_line" | cut -d: -f1)
    LINE=$(echo "$op_line" | cut -d: -f2)
    echo "\nAnalyzing workflow at $FILE:$LINE"
    
    # Check what data is used
    DATA_ACCESS=$(sed -n "${LINE},$((LINE+20))p" "$FILE" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "\.|->|\[" | head -5)
    if [ -n "$DATA_ACCESS" ]; then
      echo "Data accessed in workflow:"
      echo "$DATA_ACCESS"
    fi
  done
fi

# Check for data validation gaps
echo "--- Checking for validation gaps ---"
UNVALIDATED=$(grep -r "TODO.*validat\|FIXME.*check\|XXX.*verify" --include="*.{js,ts,go,py}" . | head -10)
if [ -n "$UNVALIDATED" ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  VALIDATION GAPS FOUND:"
  echo "$UNVALIDATED"
fi
```
