# Phase 3: Documentation Generation

## Objective
Generate comprehensive documentation artifacts based on the approved documentation plan. Create audience-specific, high-quality documentation that serves real user needs.

## Memory Integration - Start

**Retrieve Planning Context:**
```bash
# Get approved documentation plan
{memory_search, query: "documentation strategy priorities planning", repository: [current_repo], session_id: "docs-generation"}

# Get discovery findings for reference
{memory_search, query: "documentation audit gaps", repository: [current_repo], session_id: "docs-generation"}

# Check for existing documentation patterns
{memory_search, query: "documentation examples templates", repository: [current_repo]}
```

## Generation Framework

### Multi-Audience Documentation Strategy

**Generation Principles:**

- **Context-Rich**: Includes practical examples and real-world scenarios
- **Actionable**: Provides concrete steps and implementation guidance

## Documentation Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Content Research and Analysis

**Automated Analysis:**
```bash
# Analyze codebase structure
find . -type f -name "*.go" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.java" | head -50

# Extract API endpoints
grep -r "route\|endpoint\|@app.route\|@GetMapping" . --include="*.go" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" | head -20

# Find configuration files
find . -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.toml" | grep -v node_modules | head -20

# Identify database schemas
find . -name "*.sql" -o -name "*migration*" -o -name "*schema*" | head -20
```

**Manual Research Points:**
1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Domain experts, architects, product owners
2. **Code Review**: Critical business logic and integration points
3. **Configuration Analysis**: Environment setup and deployment procedures
4. **Testing Analysis**: Test cases for behavior understanding
5. **Documentation Review**: Existing documentation and specifications

### Step 2: Content Generation

**Business Documentation Generation:**

**Business Logic Maps Creation:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Authentication}
    B -->|Valid| C[Process Request]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Return Error]
    C --> E{Business Rules}
    E -->|Pass| F[Execute Operation]
    E -->|Fail| G[Validation Error]
    F --> H[Update State]
    H --> I[Return Response]
```

**Technical Documentation Generation:**

**OpenAPI Generation Process:**
1. Extract API endpoints from route definitions
2. Analyze request/response models
3. Generate JSON schemas for all data types
4. Create comprehensive examples with realistic data
5. Document error responses with appropriate HTTP codes

**Integration Documentation Generation:**

**SDK Example Generation:**
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK Example
const client = new ApiClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com'
});

try {
  const result = await client.users.create({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  });
  console.log('User created:', result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error creating user:', error.message);
}
```
