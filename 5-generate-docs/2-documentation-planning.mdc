# Phase 2: Documentation Planning

## Objective
Create a comprehensive documentation strategy based on discovery phase findings. Define scope, priorities, audience mapping, and resource allocation for documentation generation.

## Memory Integration - Start

**Retrieve Discovery Context:**
```bash
# Get previous discovery findings
{memory_search, query: "documentation audit discovery gaps", repository: [current_repo], session_id: "docs-generation"}

# Check for related planning patterns
{memory_search, query: "documentation planning strategy", repository: [current_repo]}

# Get project-specific context
{memory_get_context, repository: [current_repo]}
```

## Planning Framework

### Documentation Strategy Development

#### Strategy Dimensions

**1. Audience-Priority Matrix**
Map documentation needs against audience impact:

| Audience | Impact Level | Current Coverage | Gap Severity | Priority |
|----------|--------------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| Product Teams | High/Medium/Low | Good/Fair/Poor | Critical/High/Medium/Low | 1-5 |
| Technical Teams | High/Medium/Low | Good/Fair/Poor | Critical/High/Medium/Low | 1-5 |
| Integration Teams | High/Medium/Low | Good/Fair/Poor | Critical/High/Medium/Low | 1-5 |
| Operations Teams | High/Medium/Low | Good/Fair/Poor | Critical/High/Medium/Low | 1-5 |

**2. Documentation Type Classification**

**Foundational Documentation** (Must-have):
- System architecture overview
- API specifications (OpenAPI)

# Store priority framework
{memory_store_chunk, content: "Documentation priority matrix: [priority decisions]", repository: [current_repo], session_id: "docs-generation", tags: ["documentation", "planning", "priorities"]}

# Store resource estimates
{memory_store_chunk, content: "Documentation resource requirements: [time/effort estimates]", repository: [current_repo], session_id: "docs-generation", tags: ["documentation", "planning", "resources"]}
```

## User Checkpoint âœ“

Before proceeding to Phase 3 (Documentation Generation), please review:

1. **Strategy Alignment**: Does the documentation strategy align with your business objectives?
2. **Priority Validation**: Are the priorities and sequencing appropriate for your team's needs?
3. **Resource Feasibility**: Are the time and resource estimates realistic for your organization?
4. **Quality Standards**: Do the proposed quality standards meet your requirements?
5. **Tool Selection**: Are the recommended tools compatible with your existing workflow?

**Required Decisions:**
- Which documentation categories should be prioritized first?
- What level of detail is appropriate for each audience?
- Are there any resource constraints or timeline requirements?
- Do you have preferences for documentation tools or formats?
- Who will be involved in the review and approval process?

**Optional Considerations:**
- Any specific compliance or regulatory requirements for documentation?
- Integration requirements with existing documentation systems?
- Preferences for automated vs. manual documentation generation?

Once you've reviewed the plan and provided feedback, I'll proceed to Phase 3: Documentation Generation.
