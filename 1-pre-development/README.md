# Pre-Development Document Generation

This folder contains specialized prompts for generating comprehensive pre-development documentation for LerianStudio plugins. These prompts ensure consistency with established standards and thorough requirement gathering for new plugin development.

## üìã Overview

The pre-development documentation workflow consists of three sequential prompts that build upon each other to create complete project specifications:

1. **PRD Generation** - Product Requirements Document
2. **TRD Generation** - Technical Requirements Document  
3. **Implementation Plan Generation** - Detailed execution plan

## üîó Prompt Sequence

**Output**: Comprehensive TRD with implementable technical specifications, architecture diagrams, and development standards.

### **3. Implementation Plan Generation** (`implementation-plan-generation.md`)
**Role**: Senior Engineering Manager & Technical Project Lead  
**Purpose**: Create detailed execution plans with phases, timelines, and deliverables

**Prerequisites**: Completed and approved PRD and TRD

**Key Features**:
- **Phase-Based Delivery**: 3-4 phases with incremental value delivery

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### **For New Plugin Development**

1. **Start with PRD Generation**:
   ```bash
   claude pre-development/prd-generation.md
   ```
   - Answer all comprehensive questions thoroughly
   - Provide detailed business context and requirements
   - Define user personas and use cases clearly
   - Specify performance and integration needs

2. **Generate TRD from PRD**:
   ```bash
   claude pre-development/trd-generation.md
   ```
   - Provide the completed PRD as input
   - Answer technical clarification questions
   - Review and approve technical architecture decisions
   - Validate performance targets and optimization strategies

3. **Create Implementation Plan**:
   ```bash
   claude pre-development/implementation-plan-generation.md
   ```
   - Provide both completed PRD and TRD as input
   - Specify team capacity and timeline constraints
   - Review risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Approve phase breakdown and delivery timelines

### **Output Locations**
Documents are generated in the target plugin repository:
```
docs/pre-development-docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PRD.md                    # Product Requirements Document
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TRD.md                    # Technical Requirements Document
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md    # Implementation Plan
```
