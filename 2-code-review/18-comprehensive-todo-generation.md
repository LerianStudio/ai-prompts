## 🧠 Enhanced Reasoning Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Use both Memory MCP and Sequential Thinking MCP for enhanced analysis:

### Memory MCP Integration
- Store findings, decisions, and patterns in memory for cross-session learning
- Reference previous analysis and build upon established knowledge
- Tag entries appropriately for organization and retrieval

### Sequential Thinking MCP Usage  
- Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for complex analysis and reasoning
- Break down complex problems into systematic thinking steps
- Allow thoughts to evolve and build upon previous insights
- Question assumptions and explore alternative approaches
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses through structured reasoning

This approach enables deeper analysis, better pattern recognition, and more thorough problem-solving capabilities.

## Core Task Synthesis Framework

### 0. Consolidate Pre-Generated Todo List (5min)

**Primary Consolidation**:
```bash
# Read the consolidated todo list generated by all analysis prompts
cat docs/code-review/code-review-todo-list.md

# Extract and count tasks by priority
grep -E "^### 🔴 CRITICAL|^### 🟡 HIGH|^### 🟢 MEDIUM|^### 🔵 LOW" docs/code-review/code-review-todo-list.md | sort | uniq -c

# Verify all 16 analysis types are represented
grep -E "^## .* Analysis Findings" docs/code-review/code-review-todo-list.md | wc -l
```

**Task Deduplication**:
- Identify duplicate tasks across different analyses
- Merge similar tasks with combined context
- Preserve the highest priority level when merging
- Maintain traceability to original analysis sources

### 1. Critical Issue Extraction (10min)

**High-Priority Task Discovery**:
```bash
# Extract critical findings from all analysis files
rg "🔴|Critical|High-Impact|CRITICAL|Security Risk" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2 -B 1
rg "MUST|REQUIRED|URGENT|IMMEDIATE" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
rg "vulnerability|exploit|breach|failure" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2
```

**Security & Compliance Tasks**:
```bash
# Security-related action items
rg "fix|patch|update|upgrade|implement" docs/code-review/6-SECURITY*.md docs/code-review/7-DEPENDENCY*.md docs/code-review/8-PRIVACY*.md -A 1
rg "TODO|FIXME|BUG|ISSUE" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1 -B 1
```

### 2. Development Task Classification (15min)

**Feature & Enhancement Tasks**:
```bash
# Development improvements from all analyses
rg "enhancement|improvement|optimize|refactor" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2
rg "missing|lacking|incomplete|partial" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
rg "should|could|recommend|suggest" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2
```

**Technical Debt & Quality Tasks**:
```bash
# Code quality and technical debt items
rg "debt|legacy|deprecated|outdated" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
rg "standardize|normalize|consolidate" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
rg "test|coverage|documentation" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2
```

### 3. Infrastructure & Operations Tasks (10min)

**Deployment & Monitoring Tasks**:
```bash
# Infrastructure and operational improvements
rg "deploy|monitor|alert|metric|log" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2
rg "scale|performance|availability|reliability" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
rg "backup|disaster|recovery|failover" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
```

### 4. Business Process Tasks (10min)

**Workflow & Process Improvements**:
```bash
# Business process and workflow tasks
rg "workflow|process|business|user.*experience" docs/code-review/*.md -A 2
rg "integration|client|api.*contract" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
rg "compliance|audit|policy|procedure" docs/code-review/*.md -A 1
```

### 5. Developer Comment Tags (5min)

**Personal Todo Comments Search**:
```bash
# Search for triple-slash developer comment tags
rg "///\w+" --type go,js,ts,py,java,rs,php,rb,kt,swift -A 1 -B 1
rg "///" . --include="*.{go,js,ts,py,java,rs,php,rb,kt,swift,c,cpp,h,hpp}" -A 1 -B 1
```

**Comment Context Analysis**:
- Extract developer-specific todos from inline code comments
- Parse comment format: `///NAME - description` or `///NAME: description`
- Understand context of where comment was placed (function, class, file)
- Determine priority based on code location (critical paths vs utilities)
- Add to memory_tasks todo list with proper attribution

3. **API Standardization** → Documentation → Client Integration
4. **Business Process Validation** → Workflow Automation → User Experience

### Blocking Dependencies
- [ ] Database migrations must complete before feature development
- [ ] Authentication system must be secured before user features
- [ ] Monitoring must be implemented before production deployment
- [ ] API contracts must be defined before client integration

## Resource Allocation

### Team Assignments
- **Backend Team**: Security tasks, API improvements, database optimization
- **Frontend Team**: User experience, client integration, documentation
- **DevOps Team**: Infrastructure, monitoring, deployment automation
- **QA Team**: Testing framework, coverage improvement, quality gates

### Time Estimates
- **Security & Critical**: 2-3 weeks (highest priority)
- **Development Features**: 4-6 weeks (parallel with security)
- **Infrastructure & Ops**: 3-4 weeks (ongoing)
- **Quality & Docs**: 2-3 weeks (continuous)

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Goals
- Week 1: All critical security issues resolved
- Week 2: Core user workflows functional and tested
- Week 3: Basic monitoring and alerting operational
- Week 4: API documentation complete and accurate

### Monthly Objectives
- Month 1: System secure, stable, and monitored
- Month 2: Core features complete with quality gates
- Month 3: Performance optimized and fully documented

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
1. **Database migrations** - Plan rollback strategy
2. **Authentication changes** - Staged deployment approach
3. **Infrastructure changes** - Blue-green deployment
4. **API breaking changes** - Versioning and deprecation plan

### Contingency Plans
- **Security incident**: Emergency patch process defined
- **Performance degradation**: Rollback and optimization plan
- **Feature delivery delays**: MVP scope reduction strategy
- **Resource constraints**: External contractor engagement plan

## Integration Notes

This prompt (#17) completes the analysis ecosystem by transforming technical findings into actionable project management artifacts. The global session tagging enables cross-project task coordination and resource planning across the LerianStudio ecosystem.

**Chain Completion**: This prompt synthesizes all previous analyses (#0-16) plus developer inline comments into executable project plans with clear priorities, timelines, and success metrics for immediate team implementation.

**Developer Comment Processing**: The prompt includes comprehensive search for `///AUTHOR` comment tags throughout the codebase, extracts the context where comments appear (function, class, module), assesses priority based on code criticality, and integrates them into the memory_tasks todo system with proper attribution and metadata for project coordination.
