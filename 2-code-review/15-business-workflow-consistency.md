## ðŸ§  Enhanced Reasoning Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Use both Memory MCP and Sequential Thinking MCP for enhanced analysis:

### Memory MCP Integration
- Store findings, decisions, and patterns in memory for cross-session learning
- Reference previous analysis and build upon established knowledge
- Tag entries appropriately for organization and retrieval

### Sequential Thinking MCP Usage  
- Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for complex analysis and reasoning
- Break down complex problems into systematic thinking steps
- Allow thoughts to evolve and build upon previous insights
- Question assumptions and explore alternative approaches
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses through structured reasoning

This approach enables deeper analysis, better pattern recognition, and more thorough problem-solving capabilities.

# Business Workflow Consistency Analysis

**Role**: Product Business Analyst  
**Goal**: Validate end-to-end business process integrity and workflow consistency  
**Token Optimization**: 70% reduction via focused validation matrices and dependency analysis

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED**: Read ALL previous analysis outputs:
- `docs/code-review/0-CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` - Foundation understanding
- `docs/code-review/1-ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - System design patterns
- `docs/code-review/2-API_CONTRACT_ANALYSIS.md` - Endpoint specifications
- `docs/code-review/3-DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Data flow patterns
- `docs/code-review/4-SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS.md` - Process visualizations
- `docs/code-review/5-BUSINESS_ANALYSIS.md` - Business logic and rules
- `docs/code-review/6-SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Auth/authorization flows
- `docs/code-review/7-DEPENDENCY_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` - External service dependencies
- `docs/code-review/8-PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE_ANALYSIS.md` - Data handling workflows
- `docs/code-review/9-TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md` - Business scenario coverage
- `docs/code-review/10-OBSERVABILITY_MONITORING.md` - Process tracking
- `docs/code-review/11-PRE_COMMIT_QUALITY_CHECKS.md` - Quality gates
- `docs/code-review/12-DOCUMENTATION_GENERATION.md` - Process documentation
- `docs/code-review/13-API_DOCUMENTATION_GENERATOR.md` - Client integration patterns

**Cross-Reference**: Use findings from architectural (#1), business (#5), API (#2), and testing (#9) analysis.

**Output Review**: If `docs/code-review/14-BUSINESS_WORKFLOW_CONSISTENCY.md` exists, review and update against current codebase state.

## Core Analysis Framework

### 1. Business Process Mapping (15min)

**Workflow Discovery**:
```bash
# Critical business processes identification
rg -i "workflow|process|journey|funnel" --type md,js,ts,go,py -A 3 -B 1
rg "(create|update|delete|approve|reject|submit)" controllers/ handlers/ services/ -A 2
rg "state|status|transition" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
```

**Process Chain Validation**:
- Map complete user journeys from entry to completion
- Identify process dependencies and prerequisites
- Validate state transitions and business rules
- Check for process dead-ends or infinite loops

### 2. Client Integration Consistency (10min)

**Entry Point Analysis**:
```bash
# API endpoint accessibility validation
rg "router\.|app\.|mux\." --type go,js,ts -A 1 | grep -E "(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH)"
rg "@(Get|Post|Put|Delete|Patch)" --type ts,js -A 1
rg "func.*Handler|ServeHTTP" --type go -A 3
```

**Client Journey Mapping**:
- Validate all endpoints are discoverable and documented
- Check required vs optional parameters consistency
- Verify authentication/authorization requirements
- Ensure error responses guide next actions

### 3. Information Flow Validation (10min)

**Data Consistency Checks**:
```bash
# Required field validation across layers
rg "required|mandatory|must" validation/ models/ schemas/ -A 2 -B 1
rg "validate|check|verify" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
rg "missing|empty|null|undefined" error/ --type go,js,ts,py -A 1
```

**Workflow Information Requirements**:
- Map information collection points vs usage points
- Validate required data is collected before needed
- Check for information gaps in business processes
- Verify data transformations preserve business meaning

### 4. Process Completeness Audit (10min)

**Business Logic Integrity**:
```bash
# Critical business operations validation
rg "(transaction|payment|order|booking|approval)" --type go,js,ts,py -A 3 -B 1
rg "rollback|compensate|undo|cancel" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
rg "(success|failure|error).*callback" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
```

**End-to-End Process Validation**:
- Verify all business processes have clear completion criteria
- Check for proper error handling and recovery paths
- Validate notification and feedback mechanisms
- Ensure audit trails for critical operations
