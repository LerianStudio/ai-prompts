# Cursor IDE Team Configuration

This repository contains our team's shared Cursor IDE configuration, designed to maintain consistency and enhance productivity across our development workflow. Cursor is an AI-powered IDE that helps us write better code faster.

## üìÅ Structure

```

## üéØ Purpose

This configuration is designed to:
1. Enforce consistent coding standards across the team
2. Share best practices and common patterns
3. Streamline development workflows
4. Maintain code quality and architectural principles
5. Provide unified MCP server configurations

## üîß Configuration Components

### MCP Servers (.cursor/mcp.json)

We have configured several Model Context Protocol servers to enhance our development experience:

- **Midaz** - Financial ledger system integration
- **Memory** - Persistent memory management via Docker
- **Interactive Feedback** - Real-time feedback system
- **Context7** - Context-aware documentation and assistance
- **Sequential Thinking** - Advanced problem-solving capabilities
- **Browser Tools** - Browser-based development utilities

Each server is configured with specific commands, arguments, and timeout settings to ensure optimal performance.

### Rules (.cursor/rules/)

We have defined comprehensive rules for various aspects of development:

- **Accessibility** - Guidelines for creating accessible applications
- **API Structure** - Standards for API design and implementation
- **Clean Architecture** - Principles for maintaining clean and maintainable code
- **Coding Standards** - General coding conventions and best practices
- **Components** - Guidelines for component development
- **Git Commit** - Standards for commit messages and version control
- **Internationalization** - Rules for implementing multi-language support
- **Observability** - Standards for logging, monitoring, and debugging
- **Project Structure** - Guidelines for organizing project files and directories
- **Pull Request** - Standards for code review and pull request process
- **Security** - Security best practices and guidelines
- **Serverless Functions** - Standards for serverless development
- **Slash Commands** - Custom Cursor commands for common tasks
- **State Management** - Guidelines for managing application state
- **Testing** - Standards for writing and maintaining tests

### Ignore Rules (.cursorignore)

The `.cursorignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Cursor's AI features, including:
- Build artifacts and runtime files
- Dependencies
- Test snapshots and reports
- Logs and temporary files
- Generated code
- Large static assets
- Environment files and secrets

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Copy the `.cursor` and `.cursorignore` files to your project root
4. Restart Cursor IDE to apply the configurations

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Create a new branch
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes
4. Get approval from the team

## üìù Notes

- These configurations are specifically tailored for our team's workflow
- Regular updates will be made to improve and refine the rules

## Installation (Cursor)

![Instalation on Cursor](https://github.com/noopstudios/interactive-feedback-mcp/blob/main/.github/cursor-example.jpg?raw=true)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.11 or newer.
    *   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager). Install it with:
        *   Windows: `pip install uv`
        *   Linux/Mac: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2.  **Get the code:**
    *   Clone this repository:
        `git clone https://github.com/noopstudios/interactive-feedback-mcp.git`
    *   Or download the source code.
3.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    *   `cd path/to/interactive-feedback-mcp`
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   `uv sync` (this creates a virtual environment and installs packages)
5.  **Run the MCP Server:**
    *   `uv run server.py`
6.  **Configure in Cursor:**
    *   Cursor typically allows specifying custom MCP servers in its settings. You'll need to point Cursor to this running server. The exact mechanism might vary, so consult Cursor's documentation for adding custom MCPs.
    *   **Manual Configuration (e.g., via `mcp.json`)**
        **Remember to change the `/Users/fabioferreira/Dev/scripts/interactive-feedback-mcp` path to the actual path where you cloned the repository on your system.**

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "interactive-feedback-mcp": {
              "command": "uv",
              "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/Users/fabioferreira/Dev/scripts/interactive-feedback-mcp",
                "run",
                "server.py"
              ],
              "timeout": 600,
              "autoApprove": [
                "interactive_feedback"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   You might use a server identifier like `interactive-feedback-mcp` when configuring it in Cursor.
