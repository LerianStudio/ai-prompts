**Cross-Reference**: Use findings from architectural (#1), business (#3), API (#4), and testing (#9) analysis.

**Output Review**: If `.claude/16-BUSINESS_WORKFLOW_CONSISTENCY.md` exists, review and update against current codebase state.

## Core Analysis Framework

### 1. Business Process Mapping (15min)

**Workflow Discovery**:
```bash
# Critical business processes identification
rg -i "workflow|process|journey|funnel" --type md,js,ts,go,py -A 3 -B 1
rg "(create|update|delete|approve|reject|submit)" controllers/ handlers/ services/ -A 2
rg "state|status|transition" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
```

**Process Chain Validation**:
- Map complete user journeys from entry to completion
- Identify process dependencies and prerequisites
- Validate state transitions and business rules
- Check for process dead-ends or infinite loops

### 2. Client Integration Consistency (10min)

**Entry Point Analysis**:
```bash
# API endpoint accessibility validation
rg "router\.|app\.|mux\." --type go,js,ts -A 1 | grep -E "(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH)"
rg "@(Get|Post|Put|Delete|Patch)" --type ts,js -A 1
rg "func.*Handler|ServeHTTP" --type go -A 3
```

**Client Journey Mapping**:
- Validate all endpoints are discoverable and documented
- Check required vs optional parameters consistency
- Verify authentication/authorization requirements
- Ensure error responses guide next actions

### 3. Information Flow Validation (10min)

**Data Consistency Checks**:
```bash
# Required field validation across layers
rg "required|mandatory|must" validation/ models/ schemas/ -A 2 -B 1
rg "validate|check|verify" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
rg "missing|empty|null|undefined" error/ --type go,js,ts,py -A 1
```

**Workflow Information Requirements**:
- Map information collection points vs usage points
- Validate required data is collected before needed
- Check for information gaps in business processes
- Verify data transformations preserve business meaning

### 4. Process Completeness Audit (10min)

**Business Logic Integrity**:
```bash
# Critical business operations validation
rg "(transaction|payment|order|booking|approval)" --type go,js,ts,py -A 3 -B 1
rg "rollback|compensate|undo|cancel" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
rg "(success|failure|error).*callback" --type go,js,ts,py -A 2
```

**End-to-End Process Validation**:
- Verify all business processes have clear completion criteria
- Check for proper error handling and recovery paths
- Validate notification and feedback mechanisms
- Ensure audit trails for critical operations

## Chain Integration Notes

This prompt completes the 16-prompt analysis chain by validating that technical implementations serve business needs effectively. Cross-reference architectural decisions (#1), API contracts (#4), and business analysis (#3) to ensure technical solutions align with business workflow requirements.

**Final Chain Validation**: Ensure all technical analysis outputs (#1-15) support identified business workflows and client integration patterns.
