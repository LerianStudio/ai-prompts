# 2-pre-dev-feature: Streamlined Feature Development Workflow

## Overview

The **2-pre-dev-feature** workflow is designed for rapid feature development within existing products. This streamlined 4-phase process assumes established architecture and focuses on efficient integration rather than foundational design.

## When to Use This Workflow

### ‚úÖ Use 2-pre-dev-feature for:
- Adding new functionality to existing products

- Integration with new third-party services
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes requiring significant changes

### ‚ùå Use 1-pre-dev-product instead for:
- New products or applications
- Major architectural changes
- Complete system redesigns
- New technology stack adoption
- Complex multi-feature initiatives

- **Reduced Tokens:** More efficient than sequential searches

## File Size Guidelines

All generated code follows LLM-optimized guidelines:
- **Target:** <300 lines per file
- **Maximum:** 500 lines per file (hard limit)
- **Strategy:** Logical splitting when approaching limits

## Git Workflow Integration

Every implementation task includes complete git workflow:

```bash
# Before starting each task
git checkout -b feature/FT-[feature-id]-[num]-[desc]

# After completing each task  
git commit -m "feat(FT-[feature-id]-[num]): [description]
Implemented: [what was built]
Integration: [how it connects]
Notes: [implementation details]"

git push -u origin feature/FT-[feature-id]-[num]-[desc]
```

## Quick Start

## Comparison with Product Workflow

| Aspect | 2-pre-dev-feature | 1-pre-dev-product |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Phases** | 4 | 6 |
| **Planning Time** | 1 day | 1-2 weeks |
| **Documentation** | Focused | Comprehensive |
| **User Interaction** | Targeted | Extensive |
| **Architecture** | Assumes existing | Designs new |
| **Use Case** | Feature addition | Product creation |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Feature seems too complex for this workflow"**
- Consider using 1-pre-dev-product for major architectural changes
- Break large features into smaller, incremental features

**"Integration points are unclear"**
- Use Memory MCP to retrieve more architecture context
- Ask more specific technical questions in Phase 2

**"Tasks are too large"**
- Revisit task boundaries in Phase 3
- Aim for 2-4 hour atomic tasks
- Consider file size limits when splitting tasks

**"Feature conflicts with existing system"**
- Review existing architecture patterns in Memory MCP
- Consider technical debt or refactoring before feature development
- Validate assumptions in technical approach phase
