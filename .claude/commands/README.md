This directory contains custom Claude Code commands organized by functional purpose to enhance development workflows.

## Purpose

These commands provide comprehensive tools for **JavaScript/TypeScript (React) frontend development**:

- **Code Quality & Analysis** - Review React components, refactor hooks, optimize performance
- **Documentation & Understanding** - Analyze component structure, explain React patterns
- **Development Workflow** - Create React features, debug frontend errors, optimize builds

- **Utilities** - Create, update, and manage the command system itself

All commands are optimized for modern frontend development workflows with React, TypeScript, and related ecosystems.

## Structure

Commands are organized into subdirectories by their primary function:

- `code-quality/` - Code improvement and standardization tools
