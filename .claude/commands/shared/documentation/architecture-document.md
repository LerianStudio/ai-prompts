<instructions>
Generate comprehensive architecture documentation: $ARGUMENTS

## Task Objective

Create comprehensive architecture documentation with modern tooling and best practices, focusing on documenting system design, decisions, and implementation patterns.

## Framework Selection

Choose appropriate documentation framework based on requirements:

- **C4 Model**: Context, Containers, Components, Code diagrams
- **Arc42**: Comprehensive architecture documentation template
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Decision documentation
- **PlantUML/Mermaid**: Diagram-as-code documentation
- **Structurizr**: C4 model tooling and visualization
- **Draw.io/Lucidchart**: Visual diagramming tools
  </instructions>

<context>
## Current Architecture Context

- Project structure: !`find . -type f -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.toml" | head -5`
- Documentation exists: @docs/ or @README.md (if exists)
- Architecture files: !`find . -name "*architecture*" -o -name "*design*" -o -name "*.puml" | head -3`
- Services/containers: @docker-compose.yml or @k8s/ (if exists) - using docker compose v2 syntax
- API definitions: !`find . -name "*api*" -o -name "*openapi*" -o -name "*swagger*" | head -3`

This repository uses a collaborative development approach with specialized agents and structured workflows. The codebase follows modern best practices with emphasis on maintainability, performance, and thoughtful implementation.
