# /shared:utils:summary

<instructions>
You are summarizing everything we have discussed in this chat conversation up to this message.

Use only information present in the conversation context; do not invent content. Preserve original terminology, variable names, and paths. Write in crisp business English; avoid filler. Entire summary (excluding code blocks) ≤300 words.

After generating the summary, save it using memory tools as the primary method:

1. **Primary: Use memory_create tool** to store the summary with these parameters:
   - First, determine the repository name from the current working directory
   - Use that directory path as the repository identifier

   ```json
   {
     "operation": "store_chunk",
     "options": {
       "repository": "[current-working-directory]",
       "session_id": "conversation-summary",
       "content": "# [Summary Title]\n\n[Full summary content including TLDR, bullet points, and code snippets]"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Fallback: Save to file system** only if memory tools are unavailable:
   `@protocol-assets/content/docs/shared:utils:summary/[descriptive-name].md`

Choose a clear, descriptive title based on the main topic discussed.
