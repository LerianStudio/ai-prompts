# PR Generator

<context>
Analyzes current git branch changes and generates comprehensive pull request descriptions following the standard template structure, then saves them to `pull-request.md` in the project root.
</context>

<instructions>
## Usage

This command examines only the commits made on your current feature branch (compared to its base branch like develop/main) to generate a detailed pull request description that follows the standard template structure.

```bash
/shared:development:pr-generator
/shared:development:pr-generator --title="Add user authentication system"
/shared:development:pr-generator --issue=123
/shared:development:pr-generator --title="Fix login bug" --issue=456
```

</instructions>

<process>
## Process

1. **Git Branch Analysis - CRITICAL: Branch-Only Scope**
   - **MANDATORY**: Identify actual branch point to avoid analyzing entire development history
   - Detects the base branch (develop, main, master) that the current branch was created from
   - **CRITICAL**: Uses `git log --oneline --decorate --graph -10` to identify the true branch start point
   - **NEVER** use `git log main..HEAD` or `git diff main...HEAD` as this includes all history
   - **CORRECT APPROACH**: Use `git diff HEAD~n..HEAD` where n = number of commits on the current branch
   - **CORRECT APPROACH**: Use `git log --oneline HEAD~n..HEAD` to get only branch-specific commits
   - Runs `git status --porcelain` to identify uncommitted files (excluded from PR)
   - **Enforces that PR analyzes ONLY commits made on the current feature branch, not development history**
   - Determines if this is a bug fix, feature, or breaking change based on actual branch commits

2. **Change Classification**
   - Analyzes file patterns and change types
   - Identifies the type of change (bug fix, new feature, breaking change, etc.)
   - Detects if documentation updates are needed
   - Determines testing requirements

3. **PR Description Generation**
   - Creates comprehensive description following the template format
   - Includes summary of changes and motivation based on ONLY branch-specific commits
   - Pre-fills appropriate checkboxes based on change analysis
   - Suggests testing strategies
   - Saves the generated description to `pull-request.md` in the project root
     </process>

## CRITICAL Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Branch Analysis (MANDATORY)**

```bash
# 1. Get branch structure to identify commits
git log --oneline --decorate --graph -10

# 2. Count commits unique to current branch
# Look for where branch diverged from main/develop
# Example output shows 2 commits on feature/PLU-393:
# * 06603bf (HEAD -> feature/PLU-393) fix(i18n): add missing translations
# * d40c631 feat(ui): enhance templates system with calendar filter
# * 30664b1 (develop) Merge branch 'develop' into feature/libs
```

**Step 2: Extract Branch-Only Changes (MANDATORY)**

```bash
# Use HEAD~n where n = number of branch commits
git log --oneline HEAD~2..HEAD           # Get branch commits
git diff HEAD~2..HEAD --name-status      # Get changed files
git diff HEAD~2..HEAD --stat            # Get change statistics
```

**Step 3: Validation (MANDATORY)**

- Verify commit count matches actual branch commits
- Ensure no base branch commits are included in analysis
- Confirm file changes align with branch purpose

**WRONG APPROACH - DO NOT USE:**

```bash
git log main..HEAD      # ❌ Includes entire development history
git diff main...HEAD    # ❌ Includes all changes since branch creation
```

## Implementation Requirements - CRITICAL

**MANDATORY Git Command Usage:**

1. **Branch Point Detection:**

   ```bash
   git log --oneline --decorate --graph -10
   # Identify where current branch diverged from base
   # Count commits unique to current branch
   ```

2. **Branch-Only Analysis Commands:**

   ```bash
   # For 2 commits on current branch:
   git log --oneline HEAD~2..HEAD
   git diff HEAD~2..HEAD --name-status
   git diff HEAD~2..HEAD --stat

   # NEVER use these (includes all development history):
   git log main..HEAD  # ❌ WRONG
   git diff main...HEAD  # ❌ WRONG
   ```

3. **Branch Point Validation:**
   - If branch has 3 commits: use `HEAD~3..HEAD`
   - If branch has 5 commits: use `HEAD~5..HEAD`
   - **Always verify** commit count matches actual branch commits
     </deliverables>

<formatting>
## Notes

- **Critical**: Uses `HEAD~n..HEAD` approach to analyze ONLY current branch commits
- **Branch Validation**: Verifies number of commits on branch before analysis
- **Feature Branch Scope**: Analyzes only commits made specifically on the current feature branch
- **Committed Changes Only**: Analyzes committed changes in the branch only, ignores uncommitted files
- **Precise Scope**: Prevents inclusion of entire development history in PR description
- Generated PRs reflect actual feature branch changes, not cumulative project history
- Breaking changes are flagged based on actual branch commits only
- Generated PR descriptions are saved to `pull-request.md` for easy copying to GitHub/GitLab
