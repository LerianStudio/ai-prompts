# /shared:development:commit-generator

Analyzes current git changes and generates conventional commit messages following the Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification, then saves them to `commit-message.txt` in the project root.

## Usage

This command examines your git staging area and working directory to suggest properly formatted conventional commit messages based on the changes detected.

```bash
# Analyze different sets of changes
/shared:development:commit-generator --git-scope=staged              # Generate message for staged changes only (default)
/shared:development:commit-generator --git-scope=all-changes         # Generate message for all changes (staged + unstaged)
/shared:development:commit-generator --git-scope=unstaged            # Generate message for unstaged changes only
/shared:development:commit-generator --git-scope=branch              # Generate message for branch changes
/shared:development:commit-generator --git-scope=last-commit         # Generate message based on last commit

# Basic usage (defaults to staged changes)
/shared:development:commit-generator
```

**Arguments:**

- `--git-scope`: Which git changes to analyze - staged|unstaged|all-changes|branch|last-commit|commit-range=<range> (defaults to 'staged')

## Initial Setup

### Git Scope Configuration

```bash
# Source git utilities
if ! source .claude/utils/git-utilities.sh; then
    echo "Error: Could not load git utilities. Please ensure git-utilities.sh exists." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Set default git scope if not provided
git_scope="${git_scope:-staged}"

# Process git scope (this function handles validation, stats, and file listing)
target_files=$(process_git_scope "$git_scope")
```

**Git-Scope Commit Benefits:**

- **Precise Control**: Generate messages for specific change sets (staged, branch, etc.)
- **Flexible Workflow**: Support different commit strategies and workflows
- **Better Messages**: More accurate commit messages based on targeted change analysis
- **Staging Integration**: Generate messages for exactly what will be committed

## Process

1. **Git Scope Analysis** (Enhanced)
    - Uses `get_git_files()` to analyze files in specified scope
    - Analyzes targeted changes based on git-scope parameter
    - Provides context about the scope of changes being committed

2. **Change Classification**
    - Analyzes file patterns and change types
    - Determines appropriate commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, etc.)
    - Automatically detects scope from file paths (api, ui, docs, etc.)

3. **Message Generation**
    - Creates conventional commit message following the format:

        ```
        <type>[optional scope]: <description>

        [optional body]

        [optional footer(s)]
        ```

    - Saves the generated message to `commit-message.txt` in the project root
    - Provides multiple suggestions when appropriate

## Supported Commit Types

Based on the Conventional Commits specification and Angular convention:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation only changes
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci:** Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore:** Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert:** Reverts a previous commit

## Examples

### Basic Feature Addition

```bash
/shared:development:commit-generator
```

**Output:**

```
feat: add user authentication system

- Implement JWT token validation
- Add login/logout endpoints
- Create user authentication system
```

### Analyzing Branch Changes

```bash
/shared:development:commit-generator --git-scope=branch
```

**Output:**

```
feat(api): add user authentication endpoints

- Implement /auth/login endpoint
- Add /auth/logout endpoint
- Include JWT token validation middleware
```

### Bug Fix with Scope

```
fix(api): correct user validation logic

- Fix email validation regex pattern
- Update password requirements check
```

## Notes

- If no changes are detected, the command will prompt you to stage changes first
- Multiple commit suggestions may be provided for complex changesets
- The command respects conventional commit standards for consistent git history
- Generated commit messages are saved to `commit-message.txt` for easy copying or use with `git commit -F commit-message.txt`

## DO NOT

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This commit generator must NEVER add "BREAKING CHANGE"
in commit messages under any circumstances.

- Do NOT include "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer text in any generated commit messages
- Do NOT add breaking change notifications or warnings to commit body
- Do NOT use the "!" suffix to indicate breaking changes in commit type
- Do NOT generate breaking change examples or templates

Even if breaking changes are detected in the code analysis, the commit message
generator must NOT include any breaking change indicators in the final output.
</requirements>
