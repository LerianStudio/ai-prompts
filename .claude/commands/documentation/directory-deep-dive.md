# Directory Deep Dive

Analyze directory structure, architecture patterns, and create comprehensive CLAUDE.md documentation

## Usage

```bash
/directory-deep-dive                  # Analyze current directory
/directory-deep-dive src/             # Analyze src directory
/directory-deep-dive src/components   # Analyze components directory
```

## Instructions

1. **Target Directory**
   - Focus on the specified directory `$ARGUMENTS` or the current working directory

2. **Investigate Architecture**
   - Analyze the implementation principles and architecture of the code in this directory and its subdirectories
   - Look for:
     - Design patterns being used
     - Dependencies and their purposes
     - Key abstractions and interfaces
     - Naming conventions and code organization

3. **Create or Update Documentation**
   - Create a CLAUDE.md file capturing this knowledge
   - If one already exists, update it with newly discovered information
   - Include:
     - Purpose and responsibility of this module
     - Key architectural decisions
     - Important implementation details
     - Common patterns used throughout the code
     - Any gotchas or non-obvious behaviors

4. **Ensure Proper Placement**
   - Place the CLAUDE.md file in the directory being analyzed
   - This ensures the context is loaded when working in that specific area

## CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Directory: [Directory Name]

## Purpose

## Example Output

```markdown
# Directory: src/components

## Purpose

Contains all React components organized by feature domain, following atomic design principles.

## Architecture Overview

Components follow a hierarchical structure:

- **atoms/**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs)
- **molecules/**: Simple component groups
- **organisms/**: Complex component sections
- **templates/**: Page-level layouts

## Key Components

### Button (atoms/Button.tsx)

- **Purpose**: Reusable button component with variants
- **Dependencies**: styled-components, theme
- **Used By**: All form components
- **Key Patterns**: Compound components, forwarded refs

### UserCard (molecules/UserCard.tsx)

- **Purpose**: Display user information card
- **Dependencies**: Button, Avatar, Typography
- **Used By**: UserList, ProfilePage
- **Key Patterns**: Composition, prop spreading

## Design Patterns

- **Compound Components**: Used in Form, Modal, and Dropdown
- **Render Props**: DataTable uses for custom cell rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: Each component has accompanying hooks
- **CSS-in-JS**: styled-components for all styling

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each component has .test.tsx file
- **Storybook**: Visual testing and documentation
- **Coverage**: Currently at 87%

## Gotchas and Tips

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always use theme variables, never hardcode colors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Components must be wrapped in ThemeProvider
- üí° Use the component generator: npm run generate:component
- üí° Check Storybook for usage examples
```
