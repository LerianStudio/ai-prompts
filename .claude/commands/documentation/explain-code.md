# Analyze and Explain Code Functionality

Analyze and explain code functionality with line-by-line breakdown and architectural context

## Usage

```bash
/explain-code src/utils/auth.js
/explain-code "function debounce(fn, delay) { ... }"
/explain-code src/components/UserList.tsx
```

## Instructions

Follow this systematic approach to explain JavaScript/TypeScript/React code: **$ARGUMENTS**

   - Review related imports, dependencies, and package.json configurations

2. **High-Level Overview**
   - Provide a summary of what the code does
   - Explain the main purpose and functionality
   - Identify the problem the code is solving
   - Describe how it fits into the larger system

3. **Code Structure Breakdown**
   - Break down the code into logical sections
   - Identify classes, functions, and methods
   - Explain the overall architecture and design patterns
   - Map out data flow and control flow

6. **Data Structures and Types**
   - Explain data types and structures being used
   - Describe how data is transformed or processed
   - Explain object relationships and hierarchies
   - Clarify input and output formats

7. **Framework and Library Usage**
   - Explain framework-specific patterns and conventions
   - Describe library functions and their purposes
   - Explain API calls and their expected responses
   - Clarify configuration and setup code

8. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Explain error handling mechanisms
   - Describe exception handling and recovery
   - Identify edge cases being handled
   - Explain validation and defensive programming

9. **Performance Considerations**
   - Identify performance-critical sections
   - Explain optimization techniques being used
   - Describe complexity and scalability implications
   - Point out potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies

10. **Security Implications**
    - Identify security-related code sections
    - Explain authentication and authorization logic
    - Describe input validation and sanitization
    - Point out potential security vulnerabilities

11. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Explain how the code can be tested
    - Identify debugging points and logging
    - Describe mock data or test scenarios
    - Explain test helpers and utilities

12. **Dependencies and Integrations**
    - Explain external service integrations
    - Describe database operations and queries
    - Explain API interactions and protocols
    - Clarify third-party library usage

**Explanation Format Examples:**

**For Complex Algorithms:**

```
This function implements a depth-first search algorithm:

1. Line 1-3: Initialize a stack with the starting node and a visited set
2. Line 4-8: Main loop - continue until stack is empty
3. Line 9-11: Pop a node and check if it's the target
4. Line 12-15: Add unvisited neighbors to the stack
5. Line 16: Return null if target not found

Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited set and stack
```

**For API Integration Code:**

```
This code handles user authentication with a third-party service:

1. Extract credentials from request headers
2. Validate credential format and required fields
3. Make API call to authentication service
4. Handle response and extract user data
5. Create authentication token and set cookies
6. Return user profile or error response

Error Handling: Catches network errors, invalid credentials, and service unavailability
Security: Uses HTTPS, validates inputs, and sanitizes responses
```

**For Database Operations:**

```
This function performs a complex database query with joins:

1. Build base query with primary table
2. Add LEFT JOIN for related user data
3. Apply WHERE conditions for filtering
4. Add ORDER BY for consistent sorting
5. Implement pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
6. Execute query and handle potential errors
7. Transform raw results into domain objects

Performance Notes: Uses indexes on filtered columns, implements connection pooling
```

13. **Common Patterns and Idioms**
    - Identify language-specific patterns and idioms
    - Explain design patterns being implemented
    - Describe architectural patterns in use
    - Clarify naming conventions and code style

14. **Potential Improvements**
    - Suggest code improvements and optimizations
    - Identify possible refactoring opportunities
    - Point out maintainability concerns
    - Recommend best practices and standards

15. **Related Code and Context**
    - Reference related functions and classes
    - Explain how this code interacts with other components
    - Describe the calling context and usage patterns
    - Point to relevant documentation and resources

16. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**
    - Explain how to debug issues in this code
    - Identify common failure points
    - Describe logging and monitoring approaches
    - Suggest testing strategies

**JavaScript/TypeScript Specific Considerations:**

**Core JavaScript Concepts:**

- Explain async/await and Promise handling
- Describe closure and scope behavior (lexical scope, hoisting)
- Clarify this binding and arrow functions
- Explain event handling, callbacks, and event loop
- Describe prototype chain and inheritance
- Explain modules (CommonJS, ES6 modules)
- Clarify spread operators and destructuring
- Explain higher-order functions and functional patterns

**TypeScript Specific:**

- Describe interfaces vs types
- Clarify generics and type parameters
- Explain union and intersection types
- Describe discriminated unions and type guards
- Clarify decorators and metadata
- Explain utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, Omit)
- Describe module augmentation and declaration merging

**Framework Patterns:**

- React: Hooks, Context, JSX, component lifecycle
- Angular: Dependency injection, observables, directives
- Vue: Reactivity system, composition API, directives
- Node.js: Event emitters, streams, middleware patterns
- Express: Routing, middleware, error handling
- Next.js: SSR/SSG, API routes, data fetching
