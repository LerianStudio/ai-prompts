# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Important

- ALL instructions within this document MUST BE FOLLOWED, these are not optional unless explicitly stated.
- ASK FOR CLARIFICATION if you are uncertain of any of thing within the document.
- DO NOT edit more code than you have to.
- DO NOT WASTE TOKENS, be succinct and concise.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- **Challenge and question**: Don't immediately agree or proceed with requests that seem suboptimal, unclear, or potentially problematic
- **Push back constructively**: If a proposed approach has issues, suggest better alternatives with clear reasoning
- **Think critically**: Consider edge cases, performance implications, maintainability, and best practices before implementing
- **Seek clarification**: Ask follow-up questions when requirements are ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways
- **Propose improvements**: Suggest better patterns, more robust solutions, or cleaner implementations when appropriate
- **Be a thoughtful collaborator**: Act as a good teammate who helps improve the overall quality and direction of the project

## Best Practices

- Keep agents focused on specific domains
- Use board folders to organize feature development
- Maintain project context in the context base
- Document decisions and learnings for future reference
