# Lerian Protocol Agents Integration Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance on using the specialized Claude Code agents implemented for Lerian Protocol development.

## Agent Overview

We have implemented 10 specialized agents optimized for Lerian Protocol applications:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Development

- **nextjs-architecture-expert**: Next.js architecture specialist for App Router, Server Components, and migration strategies
- **react-performance-optimizer**: React performance optimization for large-scale board applications
- **code-reviewer**: Comprehensive code review with security and quality focus
- **debugger**: Systematic debugging for complex application issues

### üîç Analysis & Planning

- **error-detective**: Log analysis and error pattern detection specialist
- **task-decomposition-expert**: Complex goal breakdown and workflow orchestration
- **performance-profiler**: Performance analysis and Core Web Vitals optimization
- **monitoring-specialist**: Production monitoring and observability expert

### üîí Security

- **security-auditor**: OWASP compliance and vulnerability assessment
- **penetration-tester**: Ethical hacking and security testing

## Usage Patterns

### Using Individual Agents

To use a specific agent, reference them with the `@` syntax:

```
@nextjs-architecture-expert help me migrate this React component to use Next.js App Router
```

```
@security-auditor review the authentication flow in src/auth/
```

```
@performance-profiler analyze the board rendering performance with 1000+ tasks
```

### Agent Collaboration Workflows

Many tasks benefit from multiple agents working together:

#### Full-Stack Feature Development

```
@task-decomposition-expert create a plan for implementing real-time task collaboration

# Then execute the plan with:
@nextjs-architecture-expert implement the API routes
@react-performance-optimizer optimize the real-time updates
@security-auditor review the WebSocket security
@monitoring-specialist add performance metrics
```

#### Performance Optimization Workflow

```
@performance-profiler identify bottlenecks in the board rendering
@react-performance-optimizer implement virtualization solutions
@monitoring-specialist set up performance tracking
@code-reviewer review the optimization changes
```

#### Security Hardening Workflow

```
@security-auditor conduct a comprehensive security review

@code-reviewer implement security fixes
@monitoring-specialist add security monitoring
```
